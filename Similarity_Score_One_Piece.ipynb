    "            \"sentences\": ['''The process of discovering a Devil Fruit's abilities in *One Piece* is a mix of trial, research, and knowledge passed down through various means. Here’s a breakdown of how Devil Fruit abilities are typically discovered or identified:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Devil Fruit Encyclopedias**:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **Devil Fruit Encyclopedias** (or Devil Fruit guidebooks) in the *One Piece* world, which contain detailed information about different types of Devil Fruits and the abilities they grant. Characters like Buggy and Blackbeard knew about the abilities of their fruits because they had read about them in such an encyclopedia. These encyclopedias seem to list known Devil Fruits along with descriptions of their powers, even providing visual references for some of the fruits.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Buggy** knew the fruit he ate was the **Bara Bara no Mi** (Chop-Chop Fruit) and its ability to split the body into pieces because he had studied it in a Devil Fruit guidebook.\n",
    "- **Blackbeard**, who was obsessed with finding the **Yami Yami no Mi** (Darkness-Darkness Fruit), was able to recognize it after seeing it, implying he had seen its image and read about its powers in an encyclopedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Previous Users**:\n",
    "\n",
    "While Devil Fruits are rare, their abilities become known through previous users. Even though a Devil Fruit disappears after its user dies and only reincarnates in a new fruit later, the knowledge of the abilities often survives through historical accounts or records. People can document the powers exhibited by a Devil Fruit user, and that information can be passed down, eventually ending up in books like the Devil Fruit encyclopedias.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the **Gura Gura no Mi** (Tremor-Tremor Fruit), used by Whitebeard, was well-known long before Blackbeard took it, because Whitebeard had demonstrated its abilities many times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Trial and Error**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, characters eat a Devil Fruit without knowing what ability it contains and discover its power through trial and error. For example, Luffy accidentally ate the **Gomu Gomu no Mi** (later revealed to be the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika) without any prior knowledge of what it would do and only found out about his rubber abilities afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Reincarnated Fruits and Their Reputation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though Devil Fruits reincarnate after the death of their user, their powers don’t disappear from public knowledge. Famous users of powerful fruits leave a legacy, and the abilities tied to those fruits become part of the lore and history. When a Devil Fruit of known power reincarnates, people who know about its previous user can recognize it. For example, after Ace died, the **Mera Mera no Mi** (Flame-Flame Fruit) became a highly sought-after item because people knew about Ace's fire abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Organizations with Knowledge (World Government, Yonko, Pirates)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain powerful organizations, like the **World Government**, **Yonko** (Four Emperors), and other major pirates, have access to extensive knowledge about Devil Fruits. They might maintain archives and records that detail the fruits' effects, locations, and potential users. Blackbeard, in particular, was part of the Whitebeard Pirates, who likely had extensive information about Devil Fruits due to their long history and many encounters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, knowledge about Devil Fruit abilities spreads through:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Devil Fruit Encyclopedias**, which provide descriptions and images of known fruits.\n",
    "- **Historical records** of famous users and their powers.\n",
    "- **Trial and error**, where users accidentally discover the abilities after eating a fruit.\n",
    "- **Passed-down knowledge** from powerful groups or organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Characters like Buggy and Blackbeard were able to know about their fruits' abilities because of these encyclopedias and their obsession with studying Devil Fruits, making them exceptions rather than the rule.''']\n",

The story of what happens to Enel after that is depicted in a series of cover stories titled **\"Enel’s Great Space Operations\"** (chapters 428–431 in the manga). Here’s a breakdown of what happened to Enel on the Moon:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Enel's Journey to the Moon (Fairy Vearth)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Enel uses his massive airship, the **Ark Maxim**, to travel from Skypiea to the Moon. He believes that the Moon is his destined paradise, calling it **Fairy Vearth**, and he sets out to explore it. Upon arrival, Enel finds that the Moon is a desolate and barren place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Discovery of the Moon’s Civilization**:\n",
    "\n",
    "While exploring the Moon, Enel stumbles upon the remnants of an ancient, technologically advanced **civilization** that once lived there. He discovers ruins and strange structures built by this ancient society. As he investigates further, he uncovers an ancient mural that depicts the history of this Moon civilization. The mural reveals that this advanced race originally lived on the Moon but eventually migrated to the Blue Planet (Earth) due to a lack of resources. The descendants of this race are believed to be the **Skypieans**, **Shandians**, and **Birkans**, explaining the connection between the sky people and the ancient Moon civilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Encounter with the Space Pirates and Automata**:\n",
    "\n",
    "During his exploration, Enel encounters **Space Pirates**, who are looting the ruins. The Space Pirates are attacking a group of **automata** (robotic creatures) that were built by the ancient Moon civilization. These automata are designed to serve and protect the ruins but have been largely dormant since the civilization collapsed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enel, using his powerful **Goro Goro no Mi** (Lightning-Lighting Fruit) powers, easily defeats the Space Pirates and inadvertently reactivates the automata by powering them with his electricity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Enel Becomes the New Ruler of the Moon**:\n",
    "\n",
    "After defeating the Space Pirates and reviving the automata, Enel essentially becomes the ruler of the Moon. The automata begin to worship him as a god, further inflating his ego. Enel, always considering himself divine, embraces this role as the ruler of this \"new\" civilization on the Moon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Implications of the Moon Civilization**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The cover story subtly expands the lore of the *One Piece* world by linking the ancient Moon civilization to the sky people on Earth, like the Skypieans and the Shandians. It suggests that the current inhabitants of the sky islands are descendants of an advanced race from the Moon who migrated to Earth long ago due to a resource crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Enel's adventure on the Moon shows that after his defeat, he found a new purpose, becoming the self-proclaimed ruler of the ancient automata on the Moon. His story adds an interesting layer to the world-building of *One Piece*, revealing the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations and suggesting deeper connections between the sky islands and the Moon.

A normal human wouldn't be able to withstand this kind of pressure on its veins' walls. If Luffy wasn't a rubber boy, they would burst. The increase in blood flow results in a higher discharge of red blood cells, which provide the human body with oxygen and nutrients. The additional oxygen and nutrients would make the muscles work more efficiently and thus result in higher speed and power. In sports this process is called blood doping. In blood doping, the discharge is increased by adding additional red blood cells, which were extracted at an earlier time, instead of letting them flow faster. Gear second also comes with side affects. The extreme oxygen usage would result in an acceleration of his breathing and the increase in his metabolism causes him to be hungrier than usual or even have a paralysis type effect after prolonged use of it, like in the second fight with Rob Lucci. Due to the acceleration and thus friction inside his body, he turns quite hot, which results in his sweat evaporating right off his body. This explains the smoke and redness of his skin. Luffy obviously needs to keep pumping or the effect wears off. As it would deplete his energy storage quite rapidly, he doesn't use gear second constantly during fights. The increase in metabolism might also affect his life expectancy as mentioned by Rob Lucci. With gear third, Luffy bites into his thumb joint, making a small opening, and blows very hard into it, which inflates his arm. He blows the air inside his bones and since our skeleton fully connects all our joints, he can then rearrange the amounts of air as he pleases through his body, without releasing it accidentally. Luffy basically pushes the air towards his hands, stretching his body, but also increasing the air-pressure. This would result in Luffy having a larger area of attack (eg: the size of a giant's hand), and an increased hardness due to the air pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the time-skip we can see how Luffy decreased the size of his arms, but focused solely on the point of contact. He pushed all the air in his hands, increasing the air pressure and thus hardness of his attacks. The air in his arms would be wasted otherwise anyway. Also since it is air he is carrying, it doesn't cost him much additional strength to move those large hands, but the additional damage done due to the vast increase in area of attack is well worth it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gear third also comes with side affects. Before the time-skip, we could see Luffy become tiny after using this attack. After attacking, Luffy blows out all additional air, resulting in a rapid decrease of body size. The rapid decrease and massive amounts of energy needed to inflate and keep the air where he likes it, makes him unable to retain his original size. I think it is mainly due to the energy he needs to position the air where he wants and keep it there, since Luffy didn't shrink after using his balloon attack. After the timeskip and training with Rayleigh, Luffy became strong enough to keep his body intact after using the 3rd Gear. With gear fourth, Luffy, similarly to gear third, bites down on his body and blows air inside.

A normal human wouldn't be able to withstand this kind of pressure on its veins' walls. If Luffy wasn't a rubber boy, they would burst. The increase in blood flow results in a higher discharge of red blood cells, which provide the human body with oxygen and nutrients. The additional oxygen and nutrients would make the muscles work more efficiently and thus result in higher speed and power. In sports this process is called blood doping. In blood doping, the discharge is increased by adding additional red blood cells, which were extracted at an earlier time, instead of letting them flow faster.

    "            \"sentences\": ['''Luffy's **Gear Second (Gear 2)** and **Gear Third (Gear 3)** attacks are techniques that take advantage of his Devil Fruit abilities, the **Gomu Gomu no Mi** (which is later revealed to be the **Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika**). These techniques were introduced after Luffy’s experiences in battles, and they allow him to push the limits of his rubber-like body. Here’s how they work:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Gear Second (Gear 2)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gear Second** is based on increasing the speed of blood circulation throughout Luffy's rubber body, enhancing his physical capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mechanism**:\n",
    "Luffy uses his legs to pump blood through his body at an accelerated rate, creating a kind of \"supercharging\" effect. Normally, such an increase in blood flow would cause a human body to overheat or collapse, but because Luffy's body is made of rubber, it can withstand this immense pressure and stress.\n",
    "2. **Effect**:\n",
    "By speeding up his blood circulation, Luffy’s muscles get more oxygen and nutrients, allowing him to move much faster, hit harder, and significantly improve his reflexes and overall strength. His metabolism and adrenaline also increase, making him much more powerful. The effect of this is visible as his skin emits steam due to the increased heat from his heightened circulation.\n",
    "3. **Enhanced Attacks**:\n",
    "In **Gear Second**, all of Luffy’s regular attacks (like his \"Gomu Gomu no Pistol\") become much faster and stronger. He adds the prefix **\"Jet\"** to his attack names, reflecting their speed and power. For example, **Jet Pistol** is a much faster and more forceful version of his regular Pistol attack.\n",
    "4. **Drawback**:\n",
    "Using **Gear Second** puts immense strain on Luffy’s body. Initially, it drained his stamina significantly and could even shorten his lifespan due to the unnatural strain on his body. However, as the story progresses, Luffy trains and learns to use Gear Second more efficiently without exhausting himself as quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Gear Third (Gear 3)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gear Third** involves inflating specific parts of Luffy's body to drastically increase the size and strength of his attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mechanism**:\n",
    "Luffy bites into his thumb (or sometimes other parts of his body) and blows air directly into his bones. Since his body is made of rubber, his bones expand and inflate like balloons. He can control where the air goes, typically directing it into one of his arms or legs. This allows Luffy to grow his limbs to gigantic proportions.\n",
    "2. **Effect**:\n",
    "By inflating his bones, Luffy increases the size of his limbs, turning them into massive, powerful weapons. The inflated limb retains its elasticity, so when Luffy swings it, it has tremendous force and weight behind it. His **Gear Third** attacks are much slower than his normal or **Gear Second** attacks due to their size, but they deliver devastating power capable of breaking through massive structures or dealing significant damage to enemies.\n",
    "3. **Enhanced Attacks**:\n",
    "Luffy calls these attacks **\"Giant\"** (or **Gigant**) attacks, such as **Gomu Gomu no Gigant Pistol**, where his arm becomes gigantic and delivers an extremely powerful punch. His other attacks, like **Gigant Axe** or **Gigant Stamp**, also follow this pattern with different parts of his body enlarged for powerful strikes.\n",
    "4. **Drawback**:\n",
    "Initially, after using **Gear Third**, Luffy would experience a drawback where he would shrink into a **chibi** or tiny version of himself. This happened because of the imbalance in inflating his bones. While in this tiny form, he would lose a significant amount of power and speed until he returned to normal size. Like with **Gear Second**, over time and through training, Luffy has reduced this drawback and can use **Gear Third** more efficiently without shrinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Luffy's Rubber Body Allows These Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Both **Gear Second** and **Gear Third** exploit the unique properties of Luffy’s rubber body:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rubber elasticity**: This allows Luffy to stretch, pump blood, or inflate his bones without permanent damage.\n",
    "- **Durability**: The elasticity of his body gives him an edge in tolerating the stress of increased blood flow or expanded bones without bursting or breaking, as a normal human body would.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Later Developments:\n",
    "\n",
    "Luffy’s Gear techniques evolve as the story progresses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gear Fourth (Gear 4)**: This technique introduces new forms, like **Boundman**, **Tankman**, and **Snakeman**, where Luffy combines the principles of **Gear Second** and **Gear Third** with Haki to create a stronger, more versatile combat mode.\n",
    "- **Haki**: Over time, Luffy combines his Gear attacks with **Haki** (specifically **Armament Haki**) to further enhance their power, durability, and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gear Second**: Increases blood circulation to greatly enhance speed, power, and reflexes. It sacrifices stamina in exchange for higher battle performance.\n",
    "- **Gear Third**: Inflates Luffy's bones to giant size, making his attacks much more powerful but initially slower and with the drawback of temporary shrinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques demonstrate Luffy’s creativity and mastery of his Devil Fruit powers as he grows stronger throughout the series.''']\n",

I'd suggest you read through it for specifics, but I've quoted the important bits from it below. The assignment of bounties: Normally, a bounty is issued by a government official or by the Marines. The idea is to tempt others into aiding the capture of the criminal so they can be brought to justice quickly. As for the value of the bounty: The amount of a bounty is determined in response to the perceived threat level of the criminal in question; the greater the threat to the world, the greater the bounty. In the eyes of a pirate, high bounties are thus usually seen as a sign of strength. After all, having been assigned a bounty means that the World Government as well as the Marines acknowledge the threat of the person to whom it is assigned. As you can see, this becomes pretty subjective, and can lead to inaccurate bounties. And we've seen this happen plenty of times, where an initially low bounty was later increased due to a proper assessment of the threat level. A clear example is Chopper, who still has a low bounty of 100 because his monster form is thought to be another being entirely. We've also seen in Arlong's case that he was bribing the local marines to suppress his true threat level, and was relatively free to do acts of piracy despite having an active bounty. One should also keep in mind the influence of the World Government on this, because they could assign a high bounty simply because of threat to them, rather than to civilians. This is the case with Nico Robin's initial bounty as a kid, and the actions taken against Ohara.  My theory on the relation with media is that it goes both ways. In the cases where Marines were present at the incident, their testimonies would be used to determine the new bounty. In other cases, they may find out the events later through the media, and update their bounties based on the gravity of the incident. (For example, what happens in Wholecake Island arc). There doesn't seem to be any proper confirmation of the system though.  Of course, it is certain that the media is used to circulate the bounties once they're set, since we've seen the 'News Coo' being the source of pirates learning about new bounties.  What warrants a decrease in bounty?  Bounties, once issued, are usually only retracted when the criminal is captured, killed, or is known to have otherwise died. A change in lifestyle will not affect the bounty. A bounty can last for over a hundred years if the criminal is not proven to be dead.  So the only viable way for a living pirate to have their bounty waived seems to be becoming a Shichibukai or their underling: Aside from death or capture, bounties may be retracted if the criminal can prove themselves an asset to either the Marines or World Government. This is the case with the Shichibukai, who are considered allies of the World Government and have their bounties retracted; this extends to any criminal serving as a subordinate to the Shichibukai, such as Caesar Clown. An interesting point the wiki mentions is the existence of a court of law:  A bounty may be removed by a court of law, as Jango's was during his mini-series. Jango's case was further aided by the pleas of the Marine Fullbody during the case. This later allowed him to enlist in the Marines under the command of Hina. A last case wherein bounty isn't reduced, but the criminals aren't captured, is when they are made slaves. Since their bounties are active, they can still be captured once freed from slavery though. Can a pirate with bounty turn in another pirate?  We don't have enough incidents regarding this to generalize, but it stands to reason that normal pirates cannot. As mentioned before, Shichibukai are considered allies of the Marines, so they may be permitted to despite being pirates.  In addition, turning in pirates is one way to prove oneself an ally of the Marines. We've seen two cases of this - Blackbeard and Trafalgar Law.  Blackbeard captures and turns over Ace, in order to be made into a Shichibukai. However, he didn't have much of a name then, and it is unclear whether he had a bounty.  Law on the other hand, is a better example. He had a 200,000,000 bounty when he was introduced as a rookie on Sabaody (Chapter 498). He then becomes a Shichibukai during the time skip, and his new bounty is revealed to be 440,000,000 (Chapter 659). He achieves the status by delivering the hearts of a hundred pirates to the Marine HQ. Considering how bounties are \"Dead or Alive\", I'd say this counts as turning them in. After the events of Dressarosa arc, he's no longer a Shichibukai and his bounty is increased to 500,000,000 (Chapter 801), while making him wanted by the Marines again. So I'd say the most logical explanation is that one needs to be have allied / neutral access to the Marines. This could be because they're already a Shichibukai, or because they are negotiating to become one, or because they have a backdoor through corrupt Marine officials (like what Arlong did).  At the end of the day, if one has an active, non-frozen bounty, then the rules imply that Marines would capture them. So it is unlikely that pirates would turn in other pirates as a normal act.''',\n",

So the only viable way for a living pirate to have their bounty waived seems to be becoming a Shichibukai or their underling: Aside from death or capture, bounties may be retracted if the criminal can prove themselves an asset to either the Marines or World Government. This is the case with the Shichibukai, who are considered allies of the World Government and have their bounties retracted; this extends to any criminal serving as a subordinate to the Shichibukai, such as Caesar Clown. An interesting point the wiki mentions is the existence of a court of law:  A bounty may be removed by a court of law, as Jango's was during his mini-series. Jango's case was further aided by the pleas of the Marine Fullbody during the case. This later allowed him to enlist in the Marines under the command of Hina. A last case wherein bounty isn't reduced, but the criminals aren't captured, is when they are made slaves. Since their bounties are active, they can still be captured once freed from slavery though. Can a pirate with bounty turn in another pirate?  We don't have enough incidents regarding this to generalize, but it stands to reason that normal pirates cannot. As mentioned before, Shichibukai are considered allies of the Marines, so they may be permitted to despite being pirates.  In addition, turning in pirates is one way to prove oneself an ally of the Marines. We've seen two cases of this - Blackbeard and Trafalgar Law.  Blackbeard captures and turns over Ace, in order to be made into a Shichibukai. However, he didn't have much of a name then, and it is unclear whether he had a bounty.  Law on the other hand, is a better example. He had a 200,000,000 bounty when he was introduced as a rookie on Sabaody (Chapter 498). He then becomes a Shichibukai during the time skip, and his new bounty is revealed to be 440,000,000 (Chapter 659). He achieves the status by delivering the hearts of a hundred pirates to the Marine HQ. Considering how bounties are \"Dead or Alive\", I'd say this counts as turning them in. After the events of Dressarosa arc, he's no longer a Shichibukai and his bounty is increased to 500,000,000 (Chapter 801), while making him wanted by the Marines again. So I'd say the most logical explanation is that one needs to be have allied / neutral access to the Marines. This could be because they're already a Shichibukai, or because they are negotiating to become one, or because they have a backdoor through corrupt Marine officials (like what Arlong did).  At the end of the day, if one has an active, non-frozen bounty, then the rules imply that Marines would capture them. So it is unlikely that pirates would turn in other pirates as a normal act.''',\n",
    "            \"sentences\": ['''The **bounty system** in *One Piece* is a fascinating aspect of the world-building, used by the **World Government** and **Marines** to quantify how dangerous or influential a pirate or criminal is, and to incentivize others (such as bounty hunters) to capture or eliminate them. The system is based on a variety of factors that reflect a character's threat to the World Government, their actions, and their strength. Let’s break down your questions and explore how the system works in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **How are bounties awarded or increased?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bounties are primarily determined by the **Marines** and **World Government**, not media outlets. They are meant to represent the level of threat that an individual poses to the World Government and the balance of power in the world. Factors that influence a bounty include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Crimes committed**: Attacking Marines, plundering towns, or causing mass destruction will often increase a bounty.\n",
    "- **Threat to the World Government**: Acts like challenging the World Government directly, defeating powerful Marines, or stirring political instability will significantly raise a bounty. For example, Luffy's bounties spike after incidents like defeating Crocodile, destroying Enies Lobby, and the events at Marineford.\n",
    "- **Influence and notoriety**: If a pirate has a large following or allies with powerful figures (like a Yonko), their influence can cause their bounty to rise, even without major acts of violence. For example, Luffy's alliance with the Grand Fleet increased his bounty after the Dressrosa arc.\n",
    "- **Strength**: Defeating powerful enemies, especially those recognized by the government (such as Shichibukai, Yonko commanders, or Marines), also contributes to a bounty increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Marines have **intelligence networks** in place to keep track of these developments. Their **Cipher Pol** units, local Marine branches, and informants help gather information. Media outlets like the **World Economic Journal**, run by **Morgans**, also play a role by reporting on significant events that catch the government's attention. However, while newspapers can spread a pirate’s notoriety, the actual decision to issue or raise a bounty comes from the World Government and Marines based on their internal assessments of the threat level.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The role of media**: The media (newspapers) helps **disseminate** information about bounties to the public, making them known worldwide, and might sometimes bring attention to incidents that might have slipped through the cracks. However, they do not directly influence how bounties are assigned or increased. The Marines and World Government can manipulate the news, but the primary purpose of newspapers like Morgans' is to spread these stories, increasing a pirate's fame or infamy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Is a bounty based more on popularity or actual threat?**\n",
    "\n",
    "While popularity and infamy can affect the **visibility** of a pirate, a bounty is fundamentally based on **threat level** to the World Government. Some pirates gain high bounties quickly due to their immense strength or actions that directly endanger the government’s interests, while others may have relatively low bounties despite being famous if they haven't posed a direct threat.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monkey D. Luffy**: Luffy’s bounties increase after significant events where he threatens the World Government, like defeating Crocodile (a Shichibukai), declaring war on the government at Enies Lobby, and joining forces with powerful allies like the Grand Fleet and Yonko territories.\n",
    "- **Boa Hancock**: Despite her incredible strength and fame, Hancock’s bounty did not rise as much because she allied with the government as a Shichibukai.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popularity in the media can **raise awareness** of a pirate, but if the pirate isn’t seen as a direct threat, their bounty may not rise significantly. However, once a pirate’s actions pose a **clear and present danger** to the World Government’s interests, their bounty will rise dramatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **What could warrant a decrease or withdrawal of a bounty?**\n",
    "\n",
    "While a **decrease** or **withdrawal** of a bounty has not been shown directly in the series, it is theoretically possible. Here are a few hypothetical scenarios where it might happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Allying with the government**: Pirates who become **Shichibukai** (Warlords of the Sea) have their bounties \"frozen.\" The bounty doesn’t disappear, but they are no longer considered targets for capture by the Marines as long as they maintain their status. For example, Crocodile and Boa Hancock had their bounties frozen when they became Warlords.\n",
    "- **Surrender or capture**: If a pirate is captured and imprisoned in a facility like **Impel Down**, their bounty would essentially become irrelevant, as they would no longer pose a threat. However, if they escape or resume their criminal activities, the bounty could be reissued or increased (as seen with Crocodile and other Impel Down escapees).\n",
    "- **Death**: Bounties are typically voided upon death, as the purpose is to eliminate or capture the threat.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **decrease** might happen if a pirate is considered to have become less of a threat, though this is rare, as the World Government tends to err on the side of caution and usually increases bounties rather than decreasing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Can a pirate with a bounty turn in another pirate for their bounty?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an interesting concept, but there are no established **formal restrictions** in the series that prevent a pirate with a bounty from turning in another pirate. In theory, a pirate could capture another and turn them in for the reward. However, there are several practical reasons why this rarely happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trust issues**: Pirates are generally not trusted by the Marines or bounty hunter agencies, so it’s unlikely the Marines would openly cooperate with a wanted pirate.\n",
    "- **Moral code**: In many cases, pirates have their own sense of honor or alliances, making it less likely that they would betray each other. Additionally, turning in another pirate for a bounty could lead to revenge from their crews or allies.\n",
    "- **Marines' response**: Even if a pirate did turn in another pirate, they would likely be arrested themselves unless they had some leverage, like being a Shichibukai.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, **bounty hunters**, like **Zoro** before joining Luffy, actively seek out pirates with bounties for the reward, and they have no restrictions as long as they deliver the criminal alive or dead, depending on the terms of the bounty.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bounties** are determined by the **Marines** and **World Government** based on the level of threat a pirate poses, considering factors like strength, criminal acts, and influence. Media outlets like **Morgans' newspaper** only help spread awareness of the bounties.\n",
    "- **Popularity** may raise awareness of a pirate, but a bounty is mainly a measure of the individual’s **danger** to the government and the stability of the world.\n",
    "- **Decreasing or withdrawing bounties** is rare, but it could happen in cases like becoming a Shichibukai, surrender, or death.\n",
    "- While a pirate can theoretically turn in another pirate for a bounty, practical issues like trust, the Marines' likely response, and pirate codes make this highly unusual.\n",

    "            \"source_sentence\": '''You can find a lot of information on the wikia page for Bounties. I'd suggest you read through it for specifics, but I've quoted the important bits from it below. The assignment of bounties: Normally, a bounty is issued by a government official or by the Marines. The idea is to tempt others into aiding the capture of the criminal so they can be brought to justice quickly. As for the value of the bounty: The amount of a bounty is determined in response to the perceived threat level of the criminal in question; the greater the threat to the world, the greater the bounty. In the eyes of a pirate, high bounties are thus usually seen as a sign of strength. After all, having been assigned a bounty means that the World Government as well as the Marines acknowledge the threat of the person to whom it is assigned. As you can see, this becomes pretty subjective, and can lead to inaccurate bounties. And we've seen this happen plenty of times, where an initially low bounty was later increased due to a proper assessment of the threat level. A clear example is Chopper, who still has a low bounty of 100 because his monster form is thought to be another being entirely. We've also seen in Arlong's case that he was bribing the local marines to suppress his true threat level, and was relatively free to do acts of piracy despite having an active bounty. One should also keep in mind the influence of the World Government on this, because they could assign a high bounty simply because of threat to them, rather than to civilians. This is the case with Nico Robin's initial bounty as a kid, and the actions taken against Ohara.  My theory on the relation with media is that it goes both ways. In the cases where Marines were present at the incident, their testimonies would be used to determine the new bounty. In other cases, they may find out the events later through the media, and update their bounties based on the gravity of the incident. (For example, what happens in Wholecake Island arc). There doesn't seem to be any proper confirmation of the system though.  Of course, it is certain that the media is used to circulate the bounties once they're set, since we've seen the 'News Coo' being the source of pirates learning about new bounties.  What warrants a decrease in bounty?  Bounties, once issued, are usually only retracted when the criminal is captured, killed, or is known to have otherwise died. A change in lifestyle will not affect the bounty. A bounty can last for over a hundred years if the criminal is not proven to be dead.

    "            \"sentences\": ['''In *One Piece*, the distinction between a **Devil Fruit user** being knocked unconscious and simply **falling asleep** in relation to the activation or deactivation of their powers is indeed an interesting and subtle one. Here’s a breakdown of why powers **deactivate** when a user is knocked unconscious but **stay active** when they are asleep:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **The Difference Between Sleep and Unconsciousness in the One Piece Universe**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In *One Piece*, the state of **unconsciousness** and **sleep** seem to function differently in relation to a Devil Fruit user's powers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sleep**: When a user falls asleep, they are still in control of their Devil Fruit abilities on a subconscious level. Sleep is a natural, temporary state of rest, during which the body and mind are not entirely disconnected from conscious control. The Devil Fruit power remains active as long as the user is not physically or mentally overwhelmed. For example, **Luffy**, when sleeping, can still retain his rubber body’s properties, and **Big Mom** retains her strength and powers even while napping.\n",
    "- **Unconsciousness**: On the other hand, being **knocked unconscious** (either through injury, exhaustion, or extreme mental shock) is a different state. This typically happens when the body and mind are overwhelmed to the point that they cannot function properly. In this state, the user loses control over their Devil Fruit abilities because the power appears to require at least some level of active or subconscious mental engagement. In other words, the fruit’s abilities are tied to the user’s **willpower** and **conscious intent**, which is lost when they are knocked out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Examples of How This Difference Plays Out**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Several examples from the series illustrate this difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Moria and the Shadows**: When **Gecko Moria** is knocked unconscious by Luffy during the Thriller Bark arc, his **Kage Kage no Mi** (Shadow-Shadow Fruit) powers lose effect, and all the shadows he had taken are released. This is because his control over the shadows requires some level of conscious effort or mental engagement. While Moria could keep the shadows under his control when he’s asleep, being knocked unconscious breaks his connection to his Devil Fruit ability.\n",
    "- **Sugar and the Toys**: **Sugar** from the Dressrosa arc controls her **Hobi Hobi no Mi** (Hobby-Hobby Fruit) power, which turns people into toys. When she is **knocked unconscious** by Usopp's \"shocking\" face, all the toys revert back to their original human or creature forms. Similar to Moria, her power requires at least a passive mental connection to remain active, which is severed when she is knocked out.\n",
    "- **Luffy and Sleep**: Throughout the series, **Luffy** continues to have his Devil Fruit powers (Gomu Gomu no Mi/Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika) even while sleeping. For example, his rubber body remains elastic, and he doesn’t revert to a \"normal\" human form when asleep. This is because the power of the fruit is intrinsic to his body, and its passive nature doesn't require active control to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Devil Fruit Powers Are Linked to the User's Willpower**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The common thread in all of this is that **Devil Fruit powers** seem to be tied to the user's **willpower**, conscious control, and mental engagement:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sleep** is a passive state in which a user’s **subconscious mind** might still be able to maintain control over their powers. The Devil Fruit ability remains as long as the user has not been overwhelmed physically or mentally.\n",
    "- **Unconsciousness**, however, occurs when the user is knocked out due to external trauma, fear, or extreme fatigue, completely severing the user's will and mental connection to the ability. In this case, the Devil Fruit powers deactivate because the user is not even subconsciously maintaining control.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ties into the **nature of Devil Fruits** themselves, which seem to fuse with the user's body and soul, but still require some level of mental or willful engagement to function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Why Sleep Doesn’t Nullify Powers**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why sleep doesn’t deactivate powers likely lies in the fact that sleep is not considered a **\"loss of control\"** but rather a **temporary state of rest**. Sleep allows for passive maintenance of abilities, and the user's subconscious mind or body can still control the fruit's power. On the other hand, being knocked unconscious represents a total **disconnection from control**, resulting in the deactivation of the power.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "In *One Piece*, Devil Fruit powers are intricately linked to the user's willpower and mental engagement. Sleep allows users to passively maintain their powers, but being knocked unconscious due to external force (like injury or shock) severs the user's control over the ability. This distinction explains why characters like **Moria** or **Sugar** lose control of their powers when knocked out but not when they sleep. The state of unconsciousness implies a total loss of the mind-body connection necessary for maintaining the Devil Fruit power.''']\n",

This makes sense as when someone is unconscious by force or alcohol, they do not dream (until they are mostly recovered) and sometimes lose control of subconsciously controlled faculties (such as bowels or, more seriously, breathing).  All of these rules seem to change fruit to fruit so it is impossible to tell if, say, Law's body switches or Van Decker's marks would revert if they were knocked unconscious.  Please note: Moria did not lose control of his zombies because he was unconscious but because he took all of their shadows into himself at the end of the fight. He did, however, lose control of the shadows when he was knocked unconscious. Most likely though he would have lost control of zombies in this situation anyways. You didn't make this mistake but I did several times while writing this.''',\n",
    "            \"sentences\": ['''In the One Piece universe, being knocked unconscious and falling asleep have different effects on Devil Fruit users. When a Devil Fruit user is knocked unconscious, their powers are nullified, meaning they lose control over their abilities. This is because being knocked unconscious is often caused by a physical blow to the head, which can disrupt the user's consciousness and ability to control their powers.\\n\\nOn the other hand, falling asleep does not have the same effect on Devil Fruit users. This is because sleep is a natural process that allows the body and mind to rest and rejuvenate, and it does not involve any physical trauma to the head or body. As a result, Devil Fruit users are still able to control their powers while they sleep.\\n\\nIn the case of Moria, he was knocked unconscious by Luffy, which caused him to lose control over the shadows he had absorbed. This allowed the shadows to escape and regain control over their own bodies. If Moria had simply fallen asleep, he would have still been able to control the shadows and prevent them from escaping.\\n\\nSimilarly, Sugar was scared unconscious by Usopp, which caused her to lose control over her Devil Fruit powers and allowed all the toys to turn back into their human forms.

Throughout the series, Luffy has been involved in numerous fights against powerful enemies, but he typically focuses on **defeating** or **incapacitating** them rather than killing them.

    "### **Has Luffy Ever Killed Anyone?**\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as what's explicitly shown or stated in the series, **Luffy has not directly killed anyone**. In most cases, his enemies survive after their defeat, either because of their durability, the intervention of others, or simply because Luffy doesn't strike killing blows. Here are a few key points to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Luffy’s Fighting Philosophy**:\n",
    "    - Luffy’s fights are motivated by a desire to protect his friends, achieve his goals (like becoming Pirate King), or bring down oppressive or evil figures. However, he doesn't aim to kill his enemies, even those who have committed terrible acts. He fights to defend, not to destroy.\n",
    "    - Luffy believes in letting his opponents live to face the consequences of their actions. For example, after defeating **Crocodile** and **Doflamingo**, two of the series' major villains, they are arrested and imprisoned rather than being killed.\n",
    "2. **Indirect Deaths**:\n",
    "    - While Luffy himself doesn't directly kill his enemies, some of his actions may result in **indirect consequences**. For example, during his fight with **Don Krieg** in the Baratie arc, Luffy destroyed Krieg's flagship, and Krieg's crew was left in the dangerous waters of the Grand Line. While this doesn't directly show Luffy killing them, their fate is left ambiguous.\n",
    "    - In the Skypiea arc, Luffy defeats **Enel**, but Enel is not killed and instead flies to the moon afterward, continuing his life there.\n",
    "3. **Villains Luffy Defeated Who Survived**:\n",
    "    - **Arlong**: Defeated, but survived and was arrested by the Marines.\n",
    "    - **Crocodile**: Defeated, imprisoned, and later escaped from Impel Down.\n",
    "    - **Rob Lucci**: Defeated in the Enies Lobby arc, but survived and returned as part of CP0.\n",
    "    - **Doflamingo**: Defeated, but not killed; instead, he was imprisoned in Impel Down.\n",
    "    - **Katakuri**: Defeated, but survived and was left in a respectful manner.\n",
    "4. **Exceptions in the World of One Piece**:\n",
    "    - Other characters, like **Zoro** or **Law**, are more willing to kill if necessary, but even then, it’s rare. Luffy, however, consistently shows a reluctance to kill, preferring to beat his enemies without taking their lives.\n",
    "    - In rare situations, if the enemy is completely irredeemable and needs to be stopped permanently, other characters or circumstances might lead to their death, but **Luffy himself avoids killing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Doesn't Luffy Kill?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Luffy’s approach fits with the tone and theme of *One Piece*:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Freedom and Hope**: Luffy’s goal is to be the freest person on the seas, and he wants others to have the opportunity for change or redemption, even if they are his enemies.\n",
    "- **Innocence and Adventure**: *One Piece* maintains a sense of optimism and adventure, and Luffy's reluctance to kill reflects that spirit. The story rarely dwells on death, focusing more on the journey and the relationships between characters.\n",
    "- **Oda’s Writing Style**: **Eiichiro Oda**, the creator of *One Piece*, has mentioned in interviews that he prefers not to have Luffy kill anyone, as the character is about liberation and freedom rather than vengeance or brutality. Oda wanted to craft a protagonist who solves problems by breaking systems of oppression rather than by eliminating individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Luffy has **never directly killed** anyone in *One Piece*. His battles often result in defeating and incapacitating his enemies, but his philosophy and the tone of the series favor giving people second chances, leaving them to face the consequences of their actions rather than outright killing them.''']\n",

    "            \"sentences\": ['''In *One Piece*, the clothes worn by **Devil Fruit users** generally don't seem to be made of any special material, but the way clothing interacts with Devil Fruit powers can vary depending on the type of Devil Fruit. The series often uses **visual logic** for clothing to maintain consistency with how powers work and for the sake of continuity, even if it isn't fully explained in-world. Here’s how clothing tends to work with different types of Devil Fruits:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Logia Users**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logia** users, who can transform their entire body into an element (like fire, ice, or magma), generally have their clothes transform along with them. This is not because of special clothing, but rather seems to be an extension of how the Logia ability works. When a Logia user shifts into their elemental form, their clothes and personal effects often seem to behave similarly, likely for ease of storytelling and visual consistency. Some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Akainu (Sakazuki)**, the user of the **Magu Magu no Mi** (Magma-Magma Fruit), can turn his body into magma, yet his clothes remain unaffected by the heat or magma transformations.\n",
    "- **Enel**, the user of the **Goro Goro no Mi** (Lightning Fruit), can turn into lightning, and his clothes also change into lightning with him.\n",
    "- **Smoker** uses the **Moku Moku no Mi** (Smoke-Smoke Fruit), turning into smoke, but his uniform remains intact during transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems to suggest that **Logia transformations extend to the user’s clothing**, allowing them to take on the properties of the element without damaging their clothes, even if logically they should.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Paramecia Users**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Paramecia** users, whose powers alter their body or affect the world around them, typically don’t have their clothes transform, but the clothes stretch or expand with their abilities. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Luffy**'s **Gomu Gomu no Mi** (later revealed as **Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika**) gives him the ability to stretch his body like rubber. His clothes (except for shoes or sandals) often stretch with him, despite no specific mention of them being made of any special material. There have been comedic moments where Luffy's clothes are damaged or torn during extreme transformations (like during Gear 3, where he blows up parts of his body). However, in general, Luffy’s clothing stretches alongside his body, maintaining its form.\n",
    "- **Buggy**’s **Bara Bara no Mi** (Chop-Chop Fruit) allows him to split his body into pieces. His clothing splits along with him, meaning his clothing seems to adapt to the power of the fruit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Zoan Users**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zoan** Devil Fruit users, who can transform into animals or hybrid forms, also seem to have their clothes shift with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chopper** is a notable example, as he transforms between his various human-reindeer forms thanks to his **Hito Hito no Mi** (Human-Human Fruit). His clothing, particularly his iconic hat and shorts, always adapts to his new form.\n",
    "- **Rob Lucci**'s transformations between human, leopard, and hybrid forms during his fights with Luffy didn’t shred his clothing either.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Possible Explanations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few potential explanations for why the clothes of Devil Fruit users remain largely unaffected by their abilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Oda’s Artistic Logic**: Eiichiro Oda, the creator of *One Piece*, uses artistic logic to ensure the characters look consistent and recognizable, even during transformations or elemental shifts. This is likely a matter of convenience, keeping the characters visually the same while using their powers.\n",
    "- **Unspoken Rules in the One Piece World**: While it's never explained outright in the series, the **clothing of Devil Fruit users** might be implied to be made of materials that can withstand the transformations or abilities associated with the fruits. However, there’s no direct statement in the series suggesting that the clothing is made from special fabrics.\n",
    "- **Comedic Effect**: When clothes do tear, burn, or fail to adapt to powers, it is often used for comedic effect. For instance, Luffy's Gear 3 often causes his shirt to tear from the massive size increase, but otherwise, the series doesn’t dwell on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Exceptions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- While most of the time the clothes remain intact, there are instances where clothes can be affected, particularly in moments of extreme transformation or power usage. Luffy's **Gear 4** form causes him to balloon in size, and his clothing often adjusts to accommodate this (though his shirt tears or gets stretched out).\n",
    "- Characters who use fire-based abilities, like **Ace** or **Sabo**, often retain their clothing even though their bodies can turn into or produce flames. It is simply assumed that their abilities don't affect their clothing for convenience and visual storytelling purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "In *One Piece*, there’s no official explanation for why Devil Fruit users' clothes are unaffected by their powers, but it appears to be an artistic choice by **Eiichiro Oda** to maintain visual consistency and ease of storytelling. Whether a character is a Logia, Paramecia, or Zoan user, their clothes often transform or stretch along with their abilities, though there is no explicit mention that they are made from special materials. The occasional tearing or damage to clothing happens, but it is typically used for dramatic or comedic effect.''']\n",

    "### Main Canon (Manga and Canon Episodes)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **canonical** version of *One Piece*, Luffy's scar across his chest comes from the events during the **Marineford War (Paramount War)**. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Luffy's chest scar** was given to him by **Akainu (Sakazuki)**, the Marine Admiral, when he attacked Luffy with his magma-based powers (Magu Magu no Mi).\n",
    "- This happened during the chaotic climax of the Marineford arc when Akainu was targeting Luffy right after **Ace's death**. Luffy was heavily injured, and the scar is a permanent reminder of that near-fatal attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Episode 223 (Filler Episode)\n",
    "\n",
    "- In **Episode 223**, which you mentioned, there is a fight between Zoro and Luffy, and Zoro slashes Luffy across the chest. However, this is part of a **non-canon filler arc** known as the **Ocean’s Dream Arc**. This episode (and arc) was not written by Eiichiro Oda, the creator of *One Piece*, and does not align with the official storyline. Filler episodes are often created to give the anime time to avoid catching up too quickly to the manga and aren't considered part of the true story.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, while Zoro does give Luffy a scar in this filler episode, it doesn't explain the actual scar on his chest in the main canon of *One Piece*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the Debate?\n",
    "\n",
    "The debate exists because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- People who have only watched the anime, especially filler episodes, may get confused, thinking that the scar from Episode 223 is the \"real\" scar.\n",
    "- The *One Piece* anime sometimes mixes canon and filler content, which can confuse viewers who don’t follow the manga closely.\n",
    "- Some casual viewers might miss or forget the Marineford incident, leading to confusion about when exactly Luffy got that distinctive scar.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, while Zoro does give Luffy a scar in Episode 223, that’s a filler moment and not part of the official story. The scar on Luffy’s chest that remains is from **Akainu’s magma attack** during the Marineford War.''']\n",

After his brother Ace died, Jinbe carried him and tried to escape to Akainu. Jinbe jumps into the sea but finds the water below to be frozen. Akainu manages to strike Jinbe and harm Luffy at the same time. Jinbe apologizes to Luffy for letting him get injured. Akainu strikes Jinbe and harms Luffy at the same time It can be seen in this image that Luffy's chest is burning after Akainu's punch past through Jinbe's body. One Piece Wiki also did mention how Luffy got the X-Mark after the time skip After the Timeskip After those two years, a few things have changed. Luffy wears an open, long-sleeved red cardigan with four buttons (which shows the X-shaped scar covering most of his chest he received by then-Admiral Akainu), with a yellow sash tied around his waist, somewhat reminiscent of Gol D. Roger's outfit. He has grown slightly taller and is shown to be significantly more muscular due to his training. This can be seen in his slightly thicker neck, more pronounced deltoids, and better-defined chest.''',\n",
    "            \"sentences\": ['''The debate likely arises from the fact that Luffy has a minor X-shaped scar on his chest in episode 223, which is similar to the major scar he will later get. However, the minor scar is not explained or mentioned again in the series, and it is unclear if it is meant to be the same scar or not. The major scar that Luffy gets later in the series is caused by Akainu, as shown in chapter 625. It is possible that the minor scar in episode 223 was an early design idea that was later abandoned or changed, or it may have been intended to foreshadow the later scar. Without further information from the creators, it is difficult to say for certain.''']\n",

    "In the *One Piece* series, Enel believes that the moon (which he calls \"Fairy Vearth\") is a land of endless resources and is his ideal destination, a \"continuous land\" unlike Skypiea, which is made of clouds. Here’s some more context:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enel's Obsession with Vearth\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"Vearth\"** in Skypiea refers to **soil or earth**. For the Sky People, it's a rare and precious resource because their entire world is made of clouds. Vearth is incredibly valuable in Skypiea since it can support the growth of plants and trees, which is why Enel is so obsessed with it.\n",
    "- When Enel talks about **Fairy Vearth**, he imagines it as a grand, limitless land full of Vearth, a paradise where he can rule as a god. For him, it represents freedom, endless resources, and his ultimate goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Moon as Fairy Vearth\n",
    "\n",
    "- During the **Enel’s Great Space Operations** cover story (a mini-story told through cover art in the manga), it's revealed that the place Enel calls \"Fairy Vearth\" is actually the **moon**. After Luffy defeats him, Enel constructs his flying ship, **Maxim**, and heads to the moon.\n",
    "- When Enel arrives on the moon, he discovers ancient ruins and even encounters small robot creatures (the **Spaceys**) and remnants of an ancient civilization that once lived on the moon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection to the Ancient Civilization\n",
    "\n",
    "- The manga hints at a mysterious connection between the moon and ancient civilizations, as the moon once housed a race of people who eventually descended to the Blue Planet (the world where One Piece takes place). This links to the idea that the moon holds untold history and resources, which fascinates Enel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Enel's \"Fairy Vearth\" is indeed the **moon**, and his grand delusion is that it is an endless land of Vearth (soil) where he can establish himself as a true god. While initially it seems like a crazy fantasy, his journey to the moon reveals that there’s more to it than meets the eye, with ancient secrets and history hidden on the lunar surface.''']\n",
