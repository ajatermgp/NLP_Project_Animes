       "'Monkey D. Luffy\\nFor other uses, see Straw Hat Luffy (Disambiguation).\\nFor the chapters of the same name, see Chapter 2 and Chapter 1000.\\nMonkey D. Luffy, commonly known as \"Straw Hat Luffy\" or simply \"Straw Hat\", is the founder, captain, and strongest combatant of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates. He fearlessly pursues the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger in order to become the new Pirate King and reach a further, untold dream (currently known to only his crew and closest friends). He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.\\nBorn on Dawn Island, Luffy is the son of Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon and grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp and as such is a member of the Clan of D. Most of his childhood was shaped by Garp and Curly Dadan, under whose care he befriended and swore brotherhood to the late Portgas D. \"Fire Fist\" Ace and Sabo. However, he draws his greatest inspiration from the pirate \"Red-Haired\" Shanks, who (unwittingly) enabled him to eat the Devil Fruit that turned his body into rubber, sacrificed an arm to save his life, and gifted his signature straw hat as a symbol of their vow to reunite someday, after Luffy became a great pirate.\\nAs a pirate, Luffy has actively opposed countless regional, national, and global powers, beginning with several established East Blue pirates and extending to the Marines, the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Cipher Pol, the World Nobles, and even the Four Emperors of the New World. Despite his young age and relatively short career, he has triumphed over a majority of these, successfully invading and indirectly causing the annihilation of Enies Lobby, escaping the impregnable Impel Down, enabling several key developments in the Summit War of Marineford, and defeating three Warlords and an Emperor in direct combat. At the same time, he carries a great penchant for attracting friends and allies; in addition to personally engaging every member of his crew, he has earned regard and gratitude among many nations, fellow pirates, the Revolutionary Army, and even several Marines.\\nLuffy has gained wide infamy through his accomplishments, heritage, and general recklessness, drawing many large bounties as well as the focused hostility of the World Government, Marine Headquarters, and Fleet Admiral Sakazuki in particular. Currently, he is recognized as a central member of the Worst Generation, the unwilling leader of the seven-crew Straw Hat Grand Fleet, and—in wake of defeating Kaidou during the Raid on Onigashima—one of the Four Emperors, with a bounty of 3,000,000,000. Upon the awakening of the Gomu Gomu no Mi after centuries, Luffy is also heralded by a few as the second coming of Joy Boy.\\nHe is the main protagonist of the One Piece manga and anime series.\\nQuick Answers\\nWhat is the significance of Monkey D. Luffy\\'s straw hat?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMonkey D. Luffy\\'s straw hat is more than just a fashion statement - it\\'s a symbol of his childhood and his dreams. The hat was given to him by his idol, the legendary pirate captain \\'Red-Haired\\' Shanks, who received it from Gol D. Roger. This hat is the reason for Luffy\\'s nickname, \\'Straw Hat Luffy\\', and it\\'s also the namesake and symbol of his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates. So, every time you see Luffy\\'s straw hat, remember it\\'s not just a hat, it\\'s a symbol of his journey and aspirations!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProvided by: Fandom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nWhat is the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger, also known as the Pirate King, is known as \\'One Piece\\'. This treasure is said to be the greatest in the world and its location was revealed by Roger just before his death. This revelation sparked the Grand Age of Pirates, with many dreaming of finding One Piece and becoming the next Pirate King.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProvided by: Community\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nWhat is Monkey D. Luffy\\'s dream?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMonkey D. Luffy\\'s ultimate dream is to become the Pirate King so he can become the person with the most freedom in the world, with the ability to travel anywhere on the ocean. He aims to find the One Piece, a legendary treasure that will earn him the coveted title of Pirate King. He\\'s confident that he can\\'t achieve this dream alone and relies on his comrades to help him. This dream is the driving force behind all of Luffy\\'s adventures in the One Piece manga. Additionally, Luffy has revealed another dream to a select few people; this dream has not been revealed to the reader yet.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProvided by: Community\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nHow did Monkey D. Luffy become the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMonkey D. Luffy became the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates through his own determination and adventurous spirit. After his body turned into rubber due to eating the Gomu Gomu no Mi, Luffy set sail with the goal of becoming the next King of the Pirates. His charismatic personality and fearless approach to challenges attracted a diverse crew who pledged their loyalty to him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProvided by: Community\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nWhat makes Monkey D. Luffy the strongest combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMonkey D. Luffy, also known as \\'Straw Hat Luffy\\', is the strongest combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates due to his fearless pursuit of the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger. His strength is recognized by many, including his opponents, despite his age and appearance often leading to underestimation. Luffy\\'s accomplishments in battle are numerous, including defeating multiple Warlords of the Sea. His heritage as the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the Revolutionary Army, also contributes to his reputation as a formidable fighter.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProvided by: Fandom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n{\"@context\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/schema.org\",\"@type\":\"FAQPage\",\"name\":\"Monkey D. Luffy\",\"mainEntity\":}\\nAppearance\\nFurther information: Monkey D. Luffy/Gallery\\nLuffy is a young man of average height with shaggy black hair, round black eyes, and a slim muscular build. He is renowned for his trademark straw hat (from which he gets his epithet \"Straw Hat Luffy\"), which was lent to him when he was young by the legendary pirate captain, \"Red-Haired\" Shanks, who in turn received it from Gol D. Roger. Before the timeskip, his main outfit consisted of a red vest, light blue denim shorts cuffed just above his knees, and tan sandals. Luffy also has a scar with two stitches underneath his left eye, which he earned as a child by stabbing his face to show Shanks that he was tough enough to be a pirate. He was severely wounded by Akainu in the Summit War of Marineford, leaving a large X-shaped scar on his chest.\\nBefore the Timeskip\\nSimilar to most of his male crewmates, Luffy has the same outfit throughout most of the series. Luffy will often wear a different outfit to suit the climate of an island (such as a hooded parka on Drum Island or desert robes in Arabasta) but will switch back to his trademark red vest and blue shorts after the adventures on that island are over. Despite this, he will wear his usual outfit in different colors and has been known to sport other miscellaneous items on his person from time to time like in Thriller Bark and Sabaody Archipelago. According to Eiichiro Oda in 37 Volume SBS, Luffy does not know how to dress stylishly so sometimes he is advised on how to dress by more fashionable team members, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, and Robin.\\nDuring the Drum Island Arc, he wore two different parkas, the first being a burgundy parka with white fur on the cuffs, hood, and hem, and then a checkered, hooded parka with the colors white, orange, and bright yellow, which Nami wore in the beginning.\\nDuring the Arabasta Arc, he wore desert robes consisting of a dark red robe with three white rings decorated along both sleeves and a light blue wrap over his head.\\nDuring the Skypiea Arc, he wore his vest open and additionally wore a black wristband around his left wrist with a white bangle over it. In 37 Volume SBS, Oda said that two members of his crew lent him accessories: a black wristband by Usopp and a white bracelet by Sanji.\\nDuring the Long Ring Long Land Arc, Luffy wore an afro on his head, dark red shorts, and red bandages on his feet, getting an image of a blue flaming skull and crossbones painted on his chest as well, when he was fighting Foxy.\\nDuring the Enies Lobby Arc, he wore black shorts with larger pockets than his blue shorts.\\nDuring the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Luffy wore a white T-shirt with the Galley-La Company emblem on it in red; red liners around the top, shoulders, and collar; and navy-blue shorts.\\nDuring the Thriller Bark Arc, he wore an orange vest and dark red shorts. After the battle against Moria in Thriller Bark, Luffy wore a dark decorated, jeweled armband around his left bicep, given to him by Nami. This armband was later revealed to be a map that leads to Captain John\\'s lost treasure, which Buggy sought for some time; Luffy handed the armband over to Buggy in exchange for his services in navigating through Impel Down.\\nDuring the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, in the manga, he wore a blue vest and red shorts (which can also be seen on the cover of Volume 52). In the anime, he wore the same blue vest, but dark blue shorts.\\nDuring the Amazon Lily Arc, Luffy wore a light blue vest with maroon shorts.\\nDuring the Impel Down Arc, Luffy wore his outfit from his stay on Amazon Lily until after his fight with Magellan, at which point he replaced his light blue vest with a bright yellow vest and brighter red shorts given to him by Inazuma.\\nNo matter where he is, Luffy wears his Straw Hat through absolutely everything, though at the start, the hat was prone to get knocked off his head easily, forcing Luffy to either put it aside or have someone hold onto it during fights. From the Arabasta Arc onward, he has gotten a string strap for it, which was sewn on by Nami, allowing the hat to hang on his back from his neck during fights.\\nDuring his return to Marineford to give a silent prayer, Luffy was briefly shown with four characters written on his right arm spelling 3D2Y, with the 3D crossed out to symbolize that the Straw Hat Pirates should meet up in 2 years (2Y) rather than the 3 days (3D) as planned after fleeing from Bartholomew Kuma.\\nDuring his journey, Luffy has used the power of his Devil Fruit in creative ways, many of which involve altering his body. The greatest example of his altered appearance is the creation of his Gear techniques which dramatically affect his entire body:\\nIn Gear 2, Luffy pumps more blood throughout his whole body, causing his sweat to rapidly vaporize and making it appear that he is releasing steam. In the anime, his entire skin turns slightly pink and shiny from the increased blood flow.\\nIn Gear 3 form, Luffy blows a massive amount of air into his body, causing it to inflate and enlarge a specific part of his body to a size equivalent to that of a Giant. After the transformation wears off, his body temporarily shrinks to a child-sized form, with large hands and a vertically compressed head. The properties and appearance of this technique changed after the two-year timeskip.\\nAfter the Timeskip\\nAfter those two years, a few things have changed. He has grown slightly taller and is shown to be significantly more muscular due to his training. This can be seen in his slightly thicker neck, more pronounced deltoids, and a better-defined chest, which shows the X-shaped scar he received by then-Admiral Akainu covering most of it. His usual attire is mostly the same as it was two years ago, but instead of a vest, Luffy wears an open, 3/4-sleeved red cardigan with four buttons and with a yellow sash tied around his waist with the end hanging from his left hip (somewhat reminiscent of Gol D. Roger\\'s outfit).\\nDue to Luffy\\'s increasing notoriety in addition to the increasing strength of his foes, after the timeskip he finds himself more often dressed in disguises to mask his identity, with varying levels of sophistication. Despite this, he still never loses his trademark straw hat and instead opts to at times cover it with other headwear.\\nDuring the Punk Hazard Arc, Luffy wore a long winter coat with red and white horizontal stripes, along with yellow earmuffs and dark red gloves, which he stole from one of Brownbeard\\'s Centaur Patrol Unit. Just before leaving, he switched to a different coat that is all red with dark brown fur lining and a light brown belt, as well as brown gloves.\\nDuring the Dressrosa Arc, due to his need to hide his identity in Doflamingo\\'s territory, Luffy wore an open, dark blue short-sleeved shirt with a sunflower pattern, his standard blue shorts and yellow sash, and a black bowler hat over his straw hat. He also wore a fake beard. Upon entering the tournament for the Mera Mera no Mi in the Corrida Colosseum, he wore Viking-style armor, complete with a sword and shield. Upon revision to meet the tournament\\'s weight restriction, he got rid of most of the armor, but kept the cape and helmet, along with his registration number \\'0556\\' and the word \"Lucy\" written on the back of his shirt, obscured by his cape. When he recovered after his battle against Doflamingo, Luffy wore a dark red tank top along with his standard shorts in brown (dark grey in the anime).\\nAs he and the newly formed \\'Sanji Retrieval Team\\' departed from Zou, he swapped out his standard blue shorts for a brown pair.\\nDuring the Whole Cake Island Arc, Luffy wore an open, fancy white shirt with puffy sleeves, red trim, and an ornate gold pattern on the collar along with red shorts and his standard yellow sash. He also had a decorative scarf wrapped around his straw hat after landing at the Seducing Woods, though he appears to have lost it during his battle with Charlotte Cracker. These clothes were eventually torn to shreds after several battles and he later dons a new outfit to meet with Capone Bege; a brick red blazer with matching shorts, a black dress shirt, and a pink cravat. He also fitted a black fedora to the top of his straw hat.\\nDuring his fight with Sanji, Luffy loses one of his top teeth after being struck by a Diable Jambe Joue Shot directly into his face. However, it grew back after he drank a bottle of milk.\\nDuring the Wano Country Arc, Luffy wore a red yukata with patchwork mon of a blue rounded sun on a cyan background and a yellow obi. He also had a topknot on top of his hair. He also had the Nidai Kitetsu he borrowed from Tenguyama Hitetsu. Before beginning the assault on Onigashima, Luffy received a set of samurai armor from Hitetsu. When helping Kin\\'emon and the others against Kaidou\\'s fleet at sea, Luffy wore a long black coat, his usual red shirt, orange shorts and a purple sash. He also briefly wore a Beasts Pirates disguise created by Kin\\'emon when infiltrating Onigashima, which consisted of fake red horns, black pauldrons with white lining, a black belt with white lining and the Beast Pirates jolly roger on the front, which is connected to the pauldrons by brown straps connecting to a silver ring, black leather pants, a red feather cape, orange gloves, and his regular sandals. During his celebration of the Raid\\'s success, Luffy wears another red yukata, this one with a blue sash and yellow-and-white hexagonal patterns. In the following days, he wears a third red yukata with a purple ocean wave pattern and an orange sash. As he leaves Wano, he is seen wearing his Raid outfit, though his orange shorts were swapped for yellow ones.\\nDuring the Egghead Arc, Luffy received a long red coat with orange-yellow accents and the SSG logo, along with gloves, an earpiece, and a pair of red DOM Shoes. During his fight with Kizaru, he discarded this attire, remaining in his original shorts and sandals.\\nAfter the two-year timeskip, Luffy developed another two Gears, with one of them having its own sub-transformations, as well as significantly changing Gear 3:\\nDuring Luffy\\'s two years of training, he further developed Gear 3 to have the air concentrated into his fist and a large sphere of air in his wrist, as opposed to throughout a whole limb as before. He also uses it in a variety of sizes, does not shrink afterward, and is almost always hardened with Armament Haki, giving it a shiny black appearance.\\nIn Gear 4, Luffy\\'s body proportions shift dramatically, specific to the exact form he is taking. In all forms, he gains dark rings around his eyes, and a level of Armament Haki coating over at least his arms and legs that has crimson accents in addition to the typical black.\\nIn the Boundman form, Luffy inflates himself, transforming his torso to be more spherical. He increases the size of his arms to match his torso and spreads Armament Haki coating over portions of his upper chest, creating the same type of swirls as those on the Gomu Gomu no Mi. In the process of inflating, Luffy also becomes taller and more muscular.\\nThe details of the Tankman form\\'s regular appearance are unknown, as Luffy has only used a variation called the \"Manpuku Version\". In the Manpuku Version of Tankman, Luffy\\'s body goes through a similar yet exaggerated transformation to Boundman. In this form, his torso inflates significantly more than the rest of his body, while his arms only slightly inflate. The Armament Haki coating covers most of his body except for his chest, creating a flame-like pattern. He goes through a much more significant height increase, though he loses the muscular physique of Boundman to increase the roundness of his body.\\nIn the Snakeman form, Luffy\\'s body does not shift dramatically, remaining largely the same in terms of overall proportions. While some expansion still occurs, it\\'s much less than in Boundman and Tankman, with the bulk of the transformation occurring in Luffy\\'s newly flame-like hair. Compared to the other forms, he has less Armament Haki spread, barely reaching his shoulders. He also gains a trail of steam and fire that drapes over his shoulders.\\nIn Gear 5, Luffy\\'s hair and clothes turn pure white (save for his sash and sandals). His hair takes on the appearance of a flame, and his eyes glow with large pink pupils. Like in Snakeman, he has a trail of gas draped over his shoulders, this time formed out of clouds.\\nNon-Canon\\nSimilarly to the main series, Luffy wears his standard outfit in most non-canon material. Starting with Movie 11, his standard wear is completely absent with very few exceptions.\\nDuring Movie 3, he wears a red shirt with the number \"01\" in black in the middle. A deer costume with a fur coat and two tree branches for antlers was also momentarily seen.\\nDuring the G-8 Arc, he infiltrates the kitchens as a Marine cook, wearing a white cook uniform, a blue scarf on his neck, and a white cook hat covering his straw hat.\\nDuring Movie 6, Luffy wears a bright orange hoodie with the sleeves torn off, a black wristband on his left arm, and light blue shorts.\\nDuring the Ice Hunter Arc, Luffy wears a pale-yellow parka with burgundy seams, and black triangular patches on the arms.\\nDuring Movie 9, Luffy wears a red parka.\\nDuring the Spa Island Arc, Luffy dresses in a pair of dark red swim trunks with the word \\'Mermaid\\' written on the right leg, and a pair of cyan swimming goggles. He also carries two inner tubes: a white one with dark blue stripes, and an orange one with the Criminal logo on the side.\\nDuring the Little East Blue Arc, he wears red-orange jacket exposed at the chest, and a pair of sky blue shorts.\\nDuring Movie 10, prior to his meeting with Shiki, Luffy wears bright blue swim trunks with a blue-and-white cloud pattern, along with a yellow towel. When he was sent to Mereveille along with the rest of his crewmates, he wears a dark blue loose-fitting collared shirt with two light blue \\'X\\' marks on each side, and loose pair of pale red shorts with bushy dark red rims. Slung on his shoulders are a yellow travel bag and a giant green canteen, and below his straw hat are two helmets: one yellow, and an orange one with undone straps and a pair of goggles. During his raid on Shiki\\'s palace, he dresses in a black suit with a red dress shirt and a black tie, topped with a large coat sporting gold trim and white cuffs.\\nDuring Movie 11, Luffy wears a short-sleeved orange hoodie with a gold patch saying \\'56 Gomu\\' on the left breast and both of his sleeves.\\nDuring 3D2Y, Luffy wears a bright red hoodie with a furred hood, a gold zipper, and torn sleeves, with the back of the hood sporting a pawprint design, along with white wraps around his stomach and right bicep and his regular blue shorts. Since this takes place during the two-year timeskip, his hat is noticeably absent.\\nDuring Episode of Luffy, Luffy wears a red hooded jumpsuit.\\nDuring Adventure of Nebulandia, he wears a red short-sleeved zip-up hoodie with a stylized version of his Jolly Roger splayed across the front along with his typical blue shorts and yellow sash.\\nDuring the Z\\'s Ambition Arc, Luffy wears red shorts with \\'Criminal\\' written on the left leg, and a black T-shirt showing a picture of a shark riding a wave.\\nDuring Movie 12, Luffy celebrates the \\'Cherry Blossom Party\\' wearing gray shorts and a gold V-neck shirt with a skeleton\\'s sockets and teeth stitched on the front. Under his hat is a frilly orange cap with the buckles undone. When searching for Z on Secon Island, Luffy wears a leather jacket, a blue shirt with a faded cloud-like pattern, brown shorts, and dark brown boots. Out of the gear Mobston gave the Straw Hat Pirates to prepare for their fight with the Neo Marines, he chose a bright red long coat with gold trim over a red button up shirt, a yellow vest, a dark crimson sash, and black shorts. Strapped to the coat were two rapiers and a giant piece of meat on a bone.\\nThe second outfit was designed in collaboration with Armani.\\nAt the end of Opening 16 Hands Up!, Luffy is seen wearing a fancy black coat with gold accents, a burgundy dress shirt, a black tie, black shorts, and a yellow sash.\\nIn Opening 17 Wake up!, Luffy wore a longer version of his typical red shirt with thin yellow and blood red edges over a white button-up shirt with a popped collar, an orange sash with no loose ends, blood red shorts, a yellow ball chain necklace with blood red gems hanging from the yellow ones, and a blood red, orange, and yellow striped headband. He also carries a red flag with the Straw Hat Pirates\\' Jolly Roger.\\nDuring Heart of Gold, Luffy wore red shorts and a white and orange parka, with the right breast sporting a jolly roger with the word \\'Winter\\' written above the skull. When going to explore Alchemi, he trades his parka for a furred jacket that matches his shorts, and wears a pith helmet with a flashlight, leaving his regular hat dangling around his neck.\\nDuring Movie 13, on his way to Gran Tesoro (and throughout Film: Gold Episode 0), he wore black shorts, a red helmet with a skull at the front, and red and white nio-dasuki tied around his waist. Pinned to the back is a giant blue inflatable axe, and at the front is a large black and red loincloth showing two axes and the kanji symbol for \\'Gold\\' written in gold. When changing to head into the casino, he wore a pure white blazer and shorts with a red handkerchief in his left breast pocket, a dark blue and orange Hawaiian shirt, and a straw cowboy hat with his regular one set around his neck. When planning the heist with Carina, he wore a red, yellow, and green tank top with a star that says \\'Luck\\' on the front, and light blue shorts. When choosing a disguise, he jokingly went for an orange and green dress. During the heist, he wore a black leather vest and shorts, with a pair of goggles.\\nDuring the Marine Rookie Arc, Luffy wears his standard post-timeskip outfit with a Marine coat over his shoulders.\\nAt the start of Movie 14 (and the entire Cidre Guild Arc), Luffy wears a red and white striped shirt with his Jolly Roger on the back, pale blue shorts, white sports bandages wrapped around his torso, and a pair of geta. Strapped to his back is a large wooden instrument. In his attendance at the Pirates Festival, he changes into black shorts, an orange sash, and red button-up shirt. Topping his straw hat is a beige, patterned covering with frilled edges. Strapped to his back is a seafoam green knapsack stuffed with various objects and food, and a giant green spiked shield. When leaving the Pirates Festival after his fight with Douglas Bullet, Luffy wears an orange tank top.\\nThe first outfit was designed in collaboration with UNIQLO.\\nDuring Movie 15, Luffy\\'s Festival Outfit during Uta\\'s concert was a loose-fitting red shirt, with a white \\'56\\' on the left sleeve, and the center sporting a design of a microphone wearing his straw hat. He also wore an orange vest with yellow straps, with four fans circling around it. During his flashbacks to Foosha Village (and the Uta\\'s Past Arc), Luffy wears red shorts and a white T-shirt with a yellow \\'X\\' on it. His Battle Outfit consists of a bulky leather jacket with various rings, zippers, studs, and a red cross on the left sleeve which he wears around his shoulders. Paired with a loose V-neck T-shirt with a beige Jolly Roger tilted uptilted to the right, pink-ish red torn shorts, a golden buckle with a rapier strapped to it, and a large black captain\\'s hat with a pink sash, gold trim, and a white design of a skeleton and a stripped patterning. When transforming into Gear 5 to land his final blow against Tot Musica, the Battle Outfit turns pure white as usual, though as the monster disappears his clothes morph into the form\\'s debut appearance in the Wano Country Saga: his all-white standard outfit and a purple sash.\\nReferences\\n↑ 1.0 1.1 One Piece Manga and Anime — Vol. 1 Chapter 1 (p. 5) and Episode 4, Luffy is first

       "'Charlotte Pudding\\nFor the Marine commodore of the 77th Branch, see Pudding Pudding.\\nCharlotte Pudding is the 35th daughter and the 76th child of the Charlotte Family, an officer of the Big Mom Pirates, and a hybrid between a human and a member of the Three-Eye Tribe. She also works as a chocolatier and the owner of cafe \"Caramel\" on Cacao Island, as the candidate for the vacant position of Minister of Chocolate (チョコレート大臣, Chokorēto Daijin?). She was once Sanji\\'s arranged fiancée, per the political agreement between their families. She is currently held captive by the Blackbeard Pirates.\\nDue to her actions and role, she was initially a major antagonist in the Whole Cake Island Arc, but after genuinely falling in love with Sanji, this changed as she tried to help the Straw Hat Pirates escape from her mother, Charlotte Linlin. She is also a supporting character in the Germa 66\\'s Ahh... An Emotionless Excursion cover page serial.\\nAppearance\\nPudding is a teenage girl with round, reddish brown eyes (blue in the manga), and prominent lips. She is somewhat short, shown to be about one head shorter than Sanji (who is 180 cm) when standing directly in front of him. She has light brown hair styled with pigtails in the back and side-swept bangs in the front. Her most defining feature is her third eye on her forehead, which is usually covered by her bangs.\\nAs a child, she had shorter hair tied in two pigtails. She wore a pink dress with a floral pattern, and later a red dress with a white-colored collar.\\nIn her first appearance in the Fish-Man Island Arc, her hair was styled slightly differently, being tied into a single ponytail on the top of her head and lacking her bangs, exposing her third eye. She wore a revealing pink blouse along with an orange corset, puffy red pants, red suspenders, and matching red shoes. In the photograph of her that Vito showed Sanji, she wore a blue outfit decorated with a floral pattern. When she first encountered the Sanji Retrieval Team at Cacao Island, she wore a frilly light-purple top with a pink stripe down the middle and puffy, light-purple pants. While she was at a bridal store in Sweet City, she wore a light-purple dress. At the Whole Cake Chateau prior to the wedding, she wore a light pink dress. During her \"wedding\" with Sanji, she wore a white bridal outfit with roses on both side on her hair. When she returned to Cacao Island to make the substitute wedding cake, Pudding changed her outfit into a chef\\'s attire, which includes a chef\\'s hat and an apron. Her chef outfit has a knee-length dark-colored skirt. When she parted ways with Sanji, Pudding wears a cloak. After gotten captured by the Blackbeard Pirates, Pudding wore a white shirt and black pants with the purple suspenders.\\nGallery\\n\\nMain\\nPudding with her third eye exposed.\\nPudding\\'s color scheme in the manga.\\nPudding\\'s color scheme in her wedding dress in the manga.\\nPudding\\'s first outfit as a child.\\nPudding\\'s second outfit as a child.\\nPudding\\'s outfit during the Fish-Man Island Arc.\\nPudding in the photograph sent to Sanji.\\nPudding\\'s first outfit during the Whole Cake Island Arc.\\nPudding\\'s second outfit during the Whole Cake Island Arc.\\nPudding\\'s third outfit during the Whole Cake Island Arc.\\nPudding in her wedding dress in the anime.\\nPudding in her chef outfit.\\nPudding\\'s disguise at Cacao Island.\\nPudding\\'s outfit during Germa 66\\'s Ahh...

Under her mother\\'s rule, she decided to cover her eye with her hair, which escalated to hiding more aspects of herself. Linlin\\'s tyranny made Pudding feel like her mother\\'s puppet, and she was unable to go against her orders, despite internally resenting her. In truth, Pudding is very timid, sensitive, and frightful, which she flawlessly hid with her superior acting skills. She actually possesses a strong inferiority complex concerning her third eye, planted by the mocking of children during her youth, and her own mother\\'s tactless and mean comments.\\n“\\nCharlotte Pudding: I\\'ve deceived countless people like this!Sanji: And were you, yourself, one of them, Pudding-chan?\\n”\\n— Sanji confronting Pudding\\'s reasons.\\nWhen Sanji became the first person in her life to say anything nice about her third eye, Pudding became emotional and even broke down in genuine tears, showing her true personality and preventing her from following her mother\\'s instructions to kill Sanji. Although she attempted to kill Sanji (even after he saved her life) while admitting about her true nature and that she had deceived him, Sanji surmised that Pudding was deceiving herself as much as she was deceiving others.\\nHaving been touched by Sanji\\'s kindness, Pudding developed a genuine romantic fixation on Sanji and an \\'erratic personality disorder\\' centered around him, which can best be described as an extreme form of tsundere. Her moods rapidly switches between her dishonest \\'tsun\\' half, in which she openly and seemingly happily scorns Sanji (and those associated with him), to her loving \\'dere\\' half, where she would blush and act affectionately towards him. This dichotomy of emotions confuses even Pudding, as she wonders aloud why she behaves the way she does after her emotions take hold. Whenever she watches Sanji do something incredible, Pudding blushes heavily, even getting a nosebleed herself as seen when witnessing Sanji kick her brother Oven aside. She even has developed a genuine care for Sanji\\'s interests, as she showed concern for Luffy after hearing about his fight with Charlotte Katakuri and for Chiffon when Oven threatened her life.\\n \\nThanks to her acting skills, Pudding created a mask of a vicious and cruel person. As part of her mother\\'s plan to assassinate the entire Vinsmoke Family, Pudding deceived Sanji into believing she loved him, taking advantage of his attraction towards her as well as his own vulnerable state of mind (caused by her family taking his friends and Zeff hostage). She also successfully deceived the Straw Hats who had come to retrieve Sanji, convincing them that she would release Sanji from their arranged marriage and help them reunite with him. As part of her act, she also mocks and insults her enemies, and will simply ignore efforts to insult her back. She showed a great degree of sadism as she enjoys torturing her opponents with the horrific truth as soon as she believes she can get away with it, which is made easier by her ability to manipulate memories.\\nBelieving people would hate her, Pudding often reveals her third eye when playing this character. Pudding seems to find her image and popularity as a \"good girl\" important and wishes to keep it up. She is willing to put a lot of effort into erasing and manipulating everyone\\'s memories to keep them from finding out her evil personality, although she wishes there was a simpler way with less work. As part of her act, Pudding appears to be a misandrist and shallow girl, with a low opinion on men, believing they are easily duped by her crocodile tears, and held Sanji\\'s love-filled confession in low regard, treating it as though it was a joke. Pudding also vocally expressed her disgust at Sanji\\'s swollen face, degrading it as ugly and unlovable, and considers him unworthy of being a proper prince. She also does not like perverted behavior being directed towards her by people she does not care for, as she becomes filled with rage and disgust when Sanji has a nosebleed after she pretends to entice him, to the point where she is overwhelmed with a stronger urge to kill him.\\n \\nAway from her family, Pudding shows another personality, more closely resembling to her true self. When Pudding was first introduced, she appeared to be a benevolent and kind girl to others. She seemed to have truly loved Sanji and wanted to marry him, but understood his wishes of wanting to return to his crew, and was even willing to help his crewmates rescue him. Upon realizing he was already imprisoned by Big Mom\\'s shackles and having no one left to rely on, she swore that she would not let the marriage be hell for him. This kind personality is often used to lure her victims into trusting her.\\nRelationships\\n\\nFamily\\n\\nCharlotte Linlin\\n“\\nI\\'m one of Mama\\'s \"favorites\" you know? She especially loves how good I am at acting.\\n”\\n— Pudding explained to Reiju that she\\'s one of Linlin\\'s favorite daughters.\\nPudding appears loyal to her mother, who knows her real nature, her strengths, and her true value to Big Mom\\'s plans. Pudding referred to herself as her mother\\'s favorite, and while she sometimes tires of Big Mom\\'s excessive pampering, she is willing to put on an act to further her mother\\'s plans. She shares her mother\\'s sadistic lust for violence. However, like most of her siblings, she is afraid of her mother.\\nDeep down, Pudding despises her mother for her cruelty and for viewing her as nothing more than a doll and for being so controlling in her life. Despite favoring Pudding, Big Mom finds Pudding\\'s third eye creepy and went as far as convincing Pudding to grow her bangs to cover it. During the ceremony, Big Mom was annoyed with Pudding\\'s failure to kill Sanji as planned. Pudding is also aware that her mother only favors her due to her potential to awaken the ability to decipher the Poneglyphs and knows that her mother\\'s \"love\" for her is solely based on how useful she is. After falling in love with Sanji after the wedding, she defied her mother to save Sanji and his friends.\\nHowever, later at Onigashima, Big Mom effectively gave up on Pudding awakening her ability to decipher the Poneglyphs and now would rather capture Nico Robin alive than wait for Pudding to be able to read them.\\nBecause of her general hatred of her mother, Pudding showed little concern for her supposed death. Although she is not certain of Big Mom\\'s status after the Raid on Onigashima she was confident in the possibility she was alive being well aware of Big Mom\\'s strength.\\nLola\\n \\nPudding talked admirably about Lola, who left Totto Land when Pudding was a child, and the two seemed to part amiably. Pudding does think highly of Lola as she refused to take her place as Minister of Chocolate, believing that Lola was more fit for the role, despite the fact that Lola is a criminal in the eyes of the Charlotte Family.\\nDaifuku\\n \\nBecause of Pudding\\'s failure to assassinate Sanji on the wedding altar, Daifuku treated her with disrespect. Daifuku considered his own younger sister to be a \"useless good for nothing\" for failing in her task and even slapped her away to take her place to kill Sanji himself. Despite that, Daifuku did not object when Pudding volunteered to make a new wedding cake for Big Mom.\\nPerospero\\nWhen Perospero was fearing for his life after manipulating Big Mom into going after the Straw Hats, Pudding eased his worries when she came up with a plan to make another cake. Her brother expressed gratitude for her actions, which would save him from Big Mom\\'s threat.\\nChiffon\\nIt appears Pudding holds her sister\\'s cooking abilities in respect, as Pudding was confident that Chiffon\\'s assistance would help her make another wedding cake for their crazed mother. During their journey to save the Straw Hats, Chiffon brought up the times they used to make cakes together, hinting that they were close. However, Chiffon was put off by Pudding\\'s fixation on Sanji after they managed to locate him in the Seducing Woods. Chiffon also acted as the voice of reason for Pudding whenever the latter\\'s \"evil\" self appeared and explained Pudding\\'s true intentions though she was exasperated by her sister\\'s personality shifts. Chiffon also scolded Pudding when she mocked Sanji after they completed the substitute wedding cake. When Oven threatened Chiffon before they left Cacao Island, Pudding tried to defend her by attempting to dissuade Oven from harming her.\\nOven\\nOven has some respect for his younger sister Pudding as he honored her request to not enter the Sweets Factory at Cacao Island while the substitute wedding cake was being made. When the chefs depart with the second wedding cake, Oven allowed Pudding to pass, but he ignored her when she begged him not to harm Chiffon.\\nFriends\\n\\nNitro and Rabiyan\\nPudding appears to be close with her homies, Nitro and Rabiyan. They remain loyal to her, even though Pudding was helping the Straw Hats escape from her mother after the destruction of the Whole Cake Chateau.\\nEnemies\\n\\nVinsmoke Reiju\\nVinsmoke Reiju originally claimed that she thought of Pudding as \"sweet\", and would be a fitting wife for Sanji. However, it is later revealed that she had long harbored suspicions about Pudding\\'s nature, leading her to conduct her own investigations. These suspicions were confirmed when Pudding caught Reiju snooping around her, leading Pudding to shoot Reiju in the leg and reveal her true nature. As Pudding gloated at Reiju, mocking Sanji in Reiju\\'s presence and speaking sadistically about the upcoming plans to have all the Vinsmokes murdered, Reiju listened passively before replying with sarcasm, which Pudding brushed aside. After further mockery directed at Reiju\\'s family, Pudding removed Reiju\\'s memories about their encounter, in an attempt to leave Reiju in the dark about her true personality. However, Sanji, having overheard everything, told Reiju about what truly happened, thus giving Reiju confirmation about the accuracy of her suspicions.\\nBlackbeard Pirates\\n“\\nMama\\'s gonna make you eat those words if she\\'s still alive...!!\\n”\\n— Pudding mocking the Blackbeard Pirates\\nBlackbeard has sent his crew to capture Pudding and take her to him as prisoner. Pudding mocked the Blackbeard Pirates, believing that if her mother was still alive, she would make them regret capturing her, though she herself seems to be uncertain about Linlin\\'s status after the Raid on Onigashima. The Blackbeard Pirates members mocked Pudding as they believed Big Mom is dead and were at that time fighting against one of her mother\\'s supposed killers as well declared the new eras only happened when the old legends were torn down.\\nOthers\\n\\nTotto Land Citizens\\nAs a child, Pudding grew up in Totto Land and was subjected to repeated discrimination by the citizens due to her third eye, being scornfully insulted as a disgusting monster by adults and viciously bullied by children of her age. Eventually, these cruel experiences utterly twisted and corrupted her personality, and she ruthlessly retaliated by stabbing one of the bullies with a knife and mercilessly hunted down the rest. As an adult, due to her concealing her third eye with her bangs along with her feigning an outward personality of kindness and innocence, Pudding is extremely popular with the citizens who respectfully address her as Pudding-sama. A police officer congratulated Pudding for her upcoming marriage, stating that they all sincerely wished for her happiness. On the day of the marriage, all the citizens in Totto Land happily celebrated, expressing great joy for Pudding. Pudding herself planned to modify all their memories after the Vinsmoke Family assassination, though is dismayed by the immense amount of hard work that is required. According to Pudding, the citizens were among the countless victims she deceived.\\nWhen Pudding claimed that she planned to put her sister Charlotte Chiffon into submission, the townspeople in Sweet City were shocked at the devious look she had on her face. After she returned to Cacao Island, the citizens there expressed sorrow that her wedding was ruined. After the baking of the substitute wedding cake was completed, Pudding received praise for her efforts.\\nSanji\\n“\\nQuit dreaming, you fool! Me, marrying that little punk?! Never in a billion years!\\n”\\n— Pudding\\'s true inceptive feelings for Sanji prior to the wedding.\\nWhen Big Mom formed a plan to assassinate the Vinsmoke Family, Pudding readily agreed to act as a willing bride-to-be for Sanji. When Sanji arrived on Totto Land, Pudding pretended to be in love with him and acted like she wanted them to have a happy marriage together, even being receptive to making an effort to free him from the marriage.\\nHowever, Pudding really thought of Sanji as nothing more than a pawn, dismissing the prospect of marrying him. She showed her utter contempt for Sanji by mocking his confession and appearance (his swollen face from being injured by his brothers), going as far as to make fun of his proposal, and pulling faces in imitation of those she thought he would make when she ultimately prepares to kill him. She further calls him \"ugly\" and a \"failure\", just like his brothers do, and even considered him unworthy to be a proper prince. Unbeknownst to her, Sanji overheard her conversation with his sister, and he was very shocked when he saw her true persona and third eye for the first time, and became devastated when she revealed that she and her mother had intended to kill the entire Vinsmoke Family during the ceremony. Upon listening to her mockeries and insults of him, Sanji was left with a broken heart, crying silently in the rain.\\nOn the day of the wedding, Pudding expressed dismay at the thought of her dress becoming splattered with blood after killing Sanji (whom she referred to as an \"idiot\"). Later, as she and Sanji prepared to appear at the ceremony, she continued her act in front of him. Sanji, while aware of her true nature, struggled with his natural responses to her attractiveness, which led Pudding to become internally irritated with his perverted behavior.\\nDuring the ceremony, Pudding was ready to go through with her mother\\'s plan. However, after Sanji called her third eye beautiful, she broke down, due to being unable in that moment to shoot the first person to compliment her third eye. Moments later, when the cake collapsed under them, Sanji did not hesitate to save her. However, after they landed, she immediately resumed her efforts to try to kill him but failed each time. Despite finally revealing her true nature to Sanji while not knowing that Sanji was already aware before the ceremony, she is once again taken off guard after he asked her if, during her deceptions of others, she had also deceived herself. Later, Pudding personally witnessed Sanji\\'s kindness by watching him heroically saving Nami from falling as she looked in shock.\\n \\nSome time after the Straw Hats escaped from the Whole Cake Chateau, Pudding told her family she was angered by Sanji\\'s words to her third eye and wanted revenge on him for his supposed mockery. This was merely an act, as it is revealed that she has fallen in love with Sanji due to his kindness and being the first (and only) to ever say something nice about her third eye. In stark contrast to her behavior towards him previously, she can no longer interact with him without blushing wildly and panicking. Motivated by her newfound feelings, she even turned on her mother for his sake and began to actively assist the Sanji Retrieval Team in escaping Whole Cake Island. However, due to also suddenly developing an erratic personality disorder, her moods switched rapidly from outwardly expressing both love and disdain for Sanji, sometimes at the same time. Despite this, however, she continued to assist Sanji and the Straw Hats even as she lapsed into her \"evil Pudding\" persona.\\nLater, they are shown to cooperate well with each other while baking Big Mom a new cake, with Pudding diligently taking instructions from Sanji. Pudding showed admiration for Sanji and becomes ecstatic whenever he does something amazing such as creating a special ingredient that made a chef faint with bliss, saving Chiffon from Oven, and lifting the carriage holding the wedding cake to Bege\\'s ship with a kick. She was also amazed by his firm objection to Bege\\'s suggestion to put poison or explosives inside the cake that was meant for her mother even though the latter previously tried to kill him. In these moments, her reactions are no different from Sanji\\'s reactions to her as she gets nosebleeds as well. Even though Pudding occasionally goes into her \"evil\" persona and speaks ill towards Sanji, he pays no mind to it.\\nAfter leaving the cake in Bege\\'s hands, Pudding took Sanji back to the Sunny so he could reunite with his crew and later back to Cacao Island so he could help his captain. Sanji graciously thanked Pudding for her help, but Pudding became extremely flustered, wanting to avoid being mistaken as a married couple. While waiting for Luffy on Cacao Island, Sanji decided to part ways with Pudding once Luffy returned and thanked Pudding again for her help. Pudding wanted to apologize to Sanji for her deception but could not bring herself to do it. Sanji also told Pudding that he was glad that she was his fiancée, causing her to become emotional again. Pudding makes one last request to Sanji and takes away his cigarette before kissing him. However, she uses her Devil Fruit ability to remove the moment from his memory before leaving him without another word. Sanji\\'s departure left Pudding deeply sad and heartbroken, as she was crying while thinking about the memories she had with Sanji.\\nOnce his brothers Niji and Yonji were captured Pudding, remembering the horrible treatment they put Sanji through his whole life, took it upon herself to angrily punch the two in the face on Sanji\\'s behalf. \\nSanji Retrieval Team\\n“\\nSo don\\'t worry. I won\\'t be marrying Sanji. Listen. The reason why I\\'ll never marry him... is because that snot-nosed idiot who\\'s head over heels for me right now... is gonna get shot to death by me... during the wedding ceremony! You kids aren\\'t gonna get out of here alive, either!\\n”\\n— Pudding revealing her initial plans for Sanji to Luffy and Nami.\\nPudding saved Monkey D. Luffy and Tony Tony Chopper from being arrested for eating her café. Appearing as though initially not knowing who they were, she was hospitable towards Luffy\\'s Sanji Retrieval Team as she took them to her home and fed them. She then pretended to want to help the team take Sanji back, putting on the act that she was in love with Sanji but would let him go. Pedro was the only one who did not trust her during the first meeting, due to the fact she is Big Mom\\'s daughter, and even suggested they restrain her. His suspicions ultimately turn out to be correct.\\nIt turned out that she lured the team into the Seducing Woods, which was crawling with enemies, and when Luffy and Nami were imprisoned by the Big Mom Pirates, she gleefully revealed to them her plan to kill Sanji and that they were never meant to leave Whole Cake Island alive, which shocked and angered them. She also referred to them both as \"kids\" despite the fact that they were both older than her. Then she left while mocking their predicament with fake tears. Brook later found out about her true nature when he was held captive by Big Mom.\\nAfter the retrieval team escaped from the Whole Cake Chateau, Pudding, who had a change of heart, decided to assist them when her crazed mother was pursuing them for wedding cake. When she approached the team, Luffy was angry to see her again but was confused by her erratic personality disorder as her outward expressions rapidly switches between wanting to help them and wanting them dead. However, Pudding did aid the team by helping them reach the coast where their ship was located.\\nWhile baking the cake for Big Mom, Pudding expressed her concern for Luffy\\'s safety due to his fight with Katakuri.\\nAbilities and Powers\\nAs an officer of the Big Mom Pirates, Pudding holds authority over lower-ranking members of her crew.\\nAs a half-member of the Three-Eye Tribe, Pudding may also be capable of awakening a true power that will allow her to decipher the text on the poneglyphs, although she has stated that she may be unable to due to her mixed heritage. She also intends to use her third eye as a means of a psychological attack, shocking Sanji with it during the wedding in order to create an opening for her to shoot him.\\nPudding possesses a strong will as she was able to withstand a burst of Big Mom\\'s Supreme King Haki and stay conscious from her loud screams.\\nPhysical Abilities\\nStrength-wise, Pudding appears nowhere near the level of most of her siblings. However, she seems to have enough strength in her arms to harm individuals whose bodies had been modified to withstand heavy damage. She also has extremely sharp eye sight as she could tell it was Sanji who kicked her brother Oven aside even when Sanji was moving so fast that no else noticed.\\nTechniques\\nPudding Punch (プリンパンチ, Purin Panchi?): Pudding punches her opponent with her right arm. This was first used against Niji and Yonji while they held captive in Mont-d\\'Or\\'s book. The punch struck both of them consecutively and was seemingly able to damage them despite their exoskeletons.\\nActing Skills\\n \\nPudding is a master of deceit, being an extremely skilled and talented actress with a specialty in drama and enticement, with Big Mom thinking highly of her ability and doting on her because of it. Before selective targets as much as in public, Pudding can unerringly adopt the personality traits of a wholly kind, gentle, and innocent woman in vast contrast to her true self, fooling nearly anyone she wants into utter manipulation, including the citizenry of Totto Land at large and some of the Straw Hats, such as Luffy and the smart, mindful Nami and Sanji (despite Luffy\\'s and Sanji\\'s aptitude in Observation Haki, to the point where said three were utterly befuddled upon learning the truth); supposedly only her family is aware of Pudding\\'s true nature. A master seductress, she uses her beauty in conjunction with such feigned persona to captivate men, particularly shown with Sanji and Brook who were completely charmed by her (as opposed to Pedro, who was not but is noted to be excessively cautious toward any stranger). More specifically, Pudding can cry at will and has a knack for making overly dramatic expressions, like when she comically mimicked Sanji in ways that Nitro and Rabiyan noted were absolutely spot on.\\nHowever, it would seem that it takes a lot of effort for Pudding to pull of her acts. She would require moments of when she could let loose her true emotions to others, such as when she sadistically revealed her true colors to Reiju when she began to investigate her, but only because she could use her Devil Fruit ability to wipe out her memory of it. Also, periods of great shock and emotion can disrupt her ability to fool others, such as when she was surprised and saddened when Sanji became the first person to ever compliment her third eye. And according to Sanji, of all the people Pudding had fooled with her acts, she deceived herself the most by convincing herself that she was a heartless monster with no true feelings for anyone else and nothing-else.\\nCulinary Expertise\\nPudding is also an extremely talented chocolatier, as both Luffy and Chopper find the chocolate biscuits with jam fillings that formed her café to be irresistible. According to herself, it is a newly-made recipe of milk, beet sugar, and cocoa butter with texture tender to the point of melting in the mouth. Her chocolate ganache is so smooth, it would slide up and out of the pot if the pots lid isn’t covering it. Pudding claims that her skill in making chocolate confectionery is superior to even the head chef of the Big Mom Pirates himself, Streusen, who is known as the finest chef in Totto Land. It was due to her skill that she was requested to succeed Lola as the Minister of Chocolate.\\nCartography\\n \\nPudding also has cartographic skills. She was shown to be able to draw a map from her memory and give navigation instructions to the Sanji Retrieval Team on Cacao Island. Furthermore, she displayed knowledge of the New World navigation method with a Log Pose.\\nMarksmanship\\nPudding\\'s primary combat skills lies in marksmanship. She is skilled enough in wielding a special revolver to accurately shoot Reiju, a commander of Germa 66, in the leg. However, her skills are still limited as she could not land a hit on Sanji, an extremely skilled Observation Haki user, even at point-blank range.\\nDevil Fruit\\nFurther information: Memo Memo no Mi\\n \\nPudding ate the Memo Memo no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows her to manipulate memories. She can reach into a person\\'s head and extract memories in the form of film strips. With this power, she can afford to reveal her true intentions and motives to her enemies without compromising the plan, as well as manipulate people into doing what she wants without them asking questions.\\nShe can cut away frames to remove specific memories from a person\\'s mind. She can then paste on new frames to add new memories, which can take the place of the removed memories. She keeps various memory frames stored in her room, so she can add them to other people\\'s memories when she needs to.\\nShe can also stimulate peoples old memories, thus distracting them from the current situation. She can even use this power on Homies, in which case, they remember the memories from the people whom their souls originally belonged to.\\nWeapons\\n \\nPudding uses a Walker .36 Caliber Percussion revolver which is loaded with Candy Jacket bullets with extraordinary percussive power, able to penetrate the armored skeletons of the Vinsmokes. Pudding intended to use it to kill Sanji during the exchange of vows, but her skills proved to be limited as Sanji was able to dodge all of her shots, from point-blank range, using Haki.\\nPudding picked up a kitchen knife in her cafe when she felt threatened by the Sanji Retrieval Team, waving it in \"self-defense\". As a child, she also used a knife to get revenge on some bullies, stabbing one of them and then chasing down the others.\\nHistory\\n\\nPast\\n \\nPudding was born 16 years ago to Charlotte Linlin and an unknown father from the Three-Eye Tribe as the 76th child of the Charlotte Family.\\nWhen she was a child, Pudding was constantly bullied and ridiculed by other children for her third eye. Even her mother found her third eye unattractive and told her to grow out her bangs to hide it. During one occasion, Pudding reached her breaking point and sought revenge on her bullies by attacking them with a knife. As a result, she developed a twisted personality, since she believed that nobody would ever see her as more than a three-eyed monster. Consequently, it became more and more easy for her to hurt others without any guilt.\\nAt some point during her childhood, she talked to her sister Lola before she fled Totto Land to escape an arranged marriage. Lola told her not to worry, certain that their mother would not kill her.\\nBig Mom and Vinsmoke Judge arranged a political marriage between Pudding and Sanji to unite the bloodlines of the Charlotte and Vinsmoke Families. The wedding was set to take place at one of Big Mom\\'s tea parties. However, Linlin plotted to assassinate the Vinsmoke Family in order to gain access to their advanced technology, and Pudding readily agreed to pretend to be a willing bride.\\nFish-Man Island Saga\\n\\nFish-Man Island Arc\\nPudding was first seen with Big Mom in the Whole Cake Chateau, sitting quietly when Big Mom received a report from Bobbin that Fish-Man Island was unable to pay their candy tribute.\\nWhole Cake Island Saga\\n\\nWhole Cake Island Arc\\nPudding first met Sanji sometime before the Sanji Retrieval Team. They formed an immediate mutual attraction, and Sanji taught Pudding a few things about cooking sweets. However, he also told her that he could not marry her, because it would forcibly separate him from his crew.\\nThree days before the wedding, Pudding was on Cacao Island, where she encountered the Sanji Retrieval Team. When Luffy and Chopper were caught eating her café, Pudding came to their defense, saying that they were hired to dismantle her café. She then invited Luffy and his group into her house for tea, where Luffy accidentally let his name slip.\\n \\nPudding was surprised to discover that the group she was conversing with was from the Straw Hat Crew, while they were also shocked to learn that Pudding was Sanji\\'s betrothed. As Pudding panicked, Pedro quickly restrained her by holding a sword to her throat, much to Nami\\'s chagrin. After calming down, Pudding explained more about the Charlotte Family and her thoughts on Sanji. Pedro then suggested keeping Pudding bound and gagged to ensure that she would not report them to Big Mom; however, Pudding showed them a secret route to Whole Cake Island and promised to bring Sanji to them the following day. Her conversation with the team ended when guards arrived to escort Pudding, and she allowed the team to sneak away.\\nThe next day, Brook and Pedro spotted Pudding and Baron Tamago shopping for Pudding\\'s wedding dress inside a bridal store in Sweet City. As she was given various dresses to try on, Pudding protested that she had something important to do, but Tamago besought her to prioritize choosing a dress. The staff inside the store suggested that Pudding select a gown which would appeal to her groom\\'s tastes, but a flustered Pudding remarked that she had only met him once before.\\n \\nAfter the Vinsmoke Family arrived at Whole Cake Chateau, Pudding had a meal with them and her mother. During the meal, Pudding asked Sanji to speak with her in private. In her room, Pudding apologized to Sanji for not bringing him to Luffy as she originally planned. Sanji showed Pudding his injured face and the explosive wristlets, much to Pudding\\'s shock. He then explained to her how his family treated him and the reason he left them in the first place as well as how they were blackmailing him into going through with the marriage. Seeing no way to escape without endangering his hands and those dear to him, Sanji explained to Pudding his intention to ask Big Mom to let his friends go in exchange for him not running away. As Pudding cried over Sanji\\'s suffering, he hugged her and told her his decision to marry her.\\nSometime later, a servant informed Pudding about the Vivre Card that was retrieved from Nami. The servant also told her that Big Mom did not approve the wedding dress Pudding chose and that she should wear the one Big Mom chose for her. Pudding then stood outside on the balcony as she remembered her mother\\'s orders and the time Lola ran away. She later went to the Prisoner Library and requested to talk to Luffy and Nami, and she entered their cell via an opening created by a bookmark. Pudding apologized for the harm her siblings had inflicted on the Straw Hats, and apologized for not meeting them on the coast like they agreed. She revealed that Sanji had proposed to her, but stated that she knew he did not truly want to marry her and so she would not marry him. She then whispered with a sinister expression that she planned to assassinate him at the wedding, shocking and angering Luffy and Nami. Pudding then said goodbye as she left their cell in tears.\\n \\nPudding later shot Vinsmoke Reiju and held her prisoner. As Pudding constrained Reiju\\'s arms using her homie Nitro, she revealed that she never wanted to marry Sanji at all, but was putting on an act to set up the Vinsmoke Family\\'s massacre at the wedding ceremony. She mocked the Vinsmokes for falling into their trap, shrugging off Reiju\\'s mocking comment about her true personality. Pudding then revealed the gun she would use to shoot the Vinsmokes, which was loaded with candy-jacketed bullets that could penetrate their iron bodies. Pudding then looked forward to seeing Sanji\\'s expression when she pulled the gun on him the next day, trying out various expressions of shock he might make. She told Reiju how Sanji\\'s proposal to her went down, gleefully mocking his desperation during the scene. In order to prevent Reiju from revealing what she had told her, Pudding extracted Reiju\\'s memories and replaced them with a memory of her being hit by a stray bullet. She then had the guards take Reiju to the infirmary.\\nPudding then went to the Room of Treasure where Big Mom was, and was annoyed when Big Mom immediately asked her if she had awakened her ability to read the poneglyphs. Pudding was surprised to see Brook in Big Mom\\'s custody, but believed he would be fine, and she asked to talk to Big Mom in private. While speaking with Big Mom, they discussed and went over their plan to assassinate the Vinsmoke Family.\\n \\nOn the wedding day, Pudding was in her room wearing her wedding dress and commented to her homies that it would be a bother having to alter many people\\'s memories after killing Sanji. Later, in the bride and groom\\'s waiting room, Pudding sat next to Sanji, who, despite being aware of her deceptions, struggled to contain his natural responses to her beauty. Pudding talked to him with a friendly persona, but was internally irritated by his behavior and could not wait to murder him. She and Sanji then flew into the wedding ceremony on a teacup on top of Zeus.\\n \\nAs they approached the altar, which was located atop an enormous wedding cake, Pudding was internally excited to kill Sanji. During the exchange of vows, Pudding prepared to assassinate Sanji when he lifted her veil to perform the kiss of oath. Following Big Mom\\'s plan, Pudding revealed her third eye to Sanji, anticipating a shocked reaction from him that would give her the necessary time to shoot him. However, much to her surprise, Sanji said in admiration that her third eye was beautiful when he took a look at it up close. Remembering her painful childhood, which was plagued by bullying directed at her third eye, even by her own mother, Pudding broke down in tears. Instead of taking the shot, she collapsed onto her knees and continued to sob as chaos broke out at the ceremony.\\n \\nAfter duplicates of Luffy emerged from the wedding cake, Sanji grabbed Pudding and jumped off the altar as the cake collapsed. After they landed, however, Pudding furiously began attempting to shoot Sanji, who dodged every shot she fired. Pudding stated that she had deceived countless people in the same way she had deceived Sanji, but she teared up and started to waver when Sanji asked her if she herself was one of those people. Her brother Daifuku then intervened, slapping Pudding aside for failing in her task before confronting Sanji himself.\\nLuffy later caused Big Mom to start screaming. While covering her ears, Pudding watched in shock as Bege, Vito, and Gotti fired their weapons at her mother. Later, as Reiju freed Nami from Smoothie\\'s grasp, Pudding gasped as she watched Sanji catch Nami in his arms.\\nLater, the Tamatebako fell to the base of the Whole Cake Chateau and exploded, causing the Chateau to topple over. The Big Mom Pirates were saved when Streusen used his ability to turn the falling castle into soft cake. Moments afterwards, Big Mom entered a rampage induced by a craving for wedding cake. Perospero managed to briefly divert her to the Straw Hats, and Pudding revealed that she could make a cake on Cacao Island with the help of Chiffon, whom she would force into assistance. Pudding also claimed that she regarded Sanji\\'s compliment on her third eye as an insult, and so she planned to seek vengeance upon him. While riding on Rabiyan, she later caught up with Bege and asked to speak with Chiffon. While speaking to Chiffon, Pudding claimed that she was trying to stop Big Mom in order to save Sanji and his friends.\\nChiffon then accompanied Pudding and the two rode on Rabiyan. They then flew to the Seducing Woods where they located Sanji, but Pudding appeared to act mysteriously different upon seeing Sanji again.\\n \\nAs the team continued fleeing from Big Mom, Pudding and Chiffon approached them. Pudding tried to tell Sanji about their mission to make a cake, but quickly impeded herself with mood swings as she went from being in love with Sanji to wanting to kill him and back. Chiffon took the lead as she petitioned for Sanji to help them make a cake to satiate Big Mom\\'s eating disorder, and Sanji readily agreed to assist them. Big Mom wondered angrily why her daughters were consorting with the Straw Hats as she unleashed a devastating air slash that barely missed them. After Sanji hopped on Rabiyan, Pudding used her Devil Fruit powers to send memories flooding into the souls in the homies, allowing the Straw Hats to make it to the coast without trouble. The trio then flew away from Whole Cake Island, passing over the Thousand Sunny.\\nAs they approached Cacao Island, Chiffon revealed to Sanji that Lola once held the position of Minister of Chocolate before she left, and Pudding constantly refused the offer to replace her due to the belief that Lola fits the position, and she did not want to take it in case she returned. Sanji then told Pudding to get out of her hiding spot inside Rabiyan\\'s folds. Pudding acted like she hated Sanji and claimed that she did not want to be seen next to him and be mistaken as his wife, but she became lovestruck when Sanji told her not to fall. As Pudding continued to be split on her feelings toward Sanji, the trio approached Cacao Island.\\n \\nPudding, Chiffon, and Sanji arrived at Chocolat Town on Cacao Island, where Sanji was hidden away inside Rabiyan\\'s folds and Chiffon acted as though she was Pudding\\'s prisoner. Pudding enlisted the help of Whole Cake Island\\'s 31 most renowned head chefs, and at the Sweets Factory, she altered their memories to make them believe the wedding had gone smoothly and Big Mom\\'s first cake had been destroyed by bad weather. The team planned to set sail in three hours and finish with the decorations by the time they deliver the cake to Big Mom. With Chiffon making the base layers, Pudding making the chocolate, and Sanji preparing a secret ingredient, the cake baking officially got underway. As Pudding and the chefs worked on making the cake, they heard a commotion outside the factory but remained focused on their task. Charlotte Brûlée spoke to Pudding through a Den Den Mushi and informed her about the Straw Hats\\' planned rendezvous point, Luffy\\'s battle with Katakuri, and Oven\\'s arrival at Cacao Island. Pudding expressed concern for Luffy, but Sanji was confident that Luffy would prevail. Sanji eventually completed his secret ingredient, the Simsim Cream, and Pudding was amazed at how it caused a chef to faint from the sweetness. With the baking of the cake completed, the chefs prepared to set sail.\\nAs Pudding and her group of chefs left the factory with the cake, they were met by Oven and Pudding told him of her plan. Oven allowed Pudding to pass but attacked Chiffon for her role in Bege\\'s assassination attempt. Pudding begged Oven to stop, but he ignored her. While Pound was trying to defend Chiffon, Pudding was amazed when Sanji (who was in disguise) instantly kicked Oven away and grabbed Chiffon without anyone noticing. While on the way to the harbor, Oven caught up to them and confronted Chiffon again before deciding to use her as a hostage to force Bege to surrender. They later went to the harbor and as Bege\\'s ship approached, Bege shot Oven in the face to free Chiffon, making Pudding concerned about angering Oven. As the Nostra Castello moved onto Cacao Island with tank treads, Sanji used a kick to lift the carriage holding the chefs (including Pudding and Chiffon) and the cake onto the deck of Bege\\'s ship. Pudding was so ecstatic that she briefly fainted. After escaping Oven and his forces, Pudding and the chefs proceeded with adding decorations to the cake.\\n \\nOn the way to the Thousand Sunny, Pudding fainted after Sanji convinced Bege not to sabotage the cake with poison or explosives. Eventually, Pudding and the chefs completed the cake. As the chefs celebrated their accomplishment, Pudding briefly relapsed into her \"evil\" persona and mocked Sanji by telling him that he might be too late, but she snapped out of it when Chiffon scolded her. While approaching the Thousand Sunny, Pudding and Sanji left the cake in Bege\\'s hands and used Rabiyan to fly to the Sunny and join up with the Straw Hats. After Sanji informed the Sunny group of the Big Mom Pirates\\' awareness of their rendezvous point, Pudding and Sanji went ahead to Cacao Island to help Luffy. While riding on Rabiyan, Sanji thanked Pudding for her help, causing her to become extremely flustered.\\n \\nAfter arriving back at Cacao Island, Sanji and Pudding hid in the shadows as they saw the forces the Big Mom Pirates gathered there. Sanji told Pudding that they would be parting ways when Luffy returned and also told her that he was glad that she was his fiancee, causing Pudding to become emotional. Before ending their conversation, Pudding made one last request. She kissed Sanji, who was overjoyed by this. Afterwards, she used her powers to erase his memory of it before she ran off, leaving him confused about her request.\\nAfter Big Mom\\'s craving stopped, the citizens praised Pudding. However, Pudding silently admitted to herself that the credit did not belong to her. When the Straw Hats escaped Totto Land, Pudding sat in an alley and cried while thinking about Sanji.\\nWano Country Saga\\nThe following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story.\\nOne Piece Film: Red\\nPudding, Brûlée, and Katakuri listened to Uta\\'s childhood song \"Where the Wind Blows\" from the Tone Dial.\\nConcludes non-canon section.\\nGerma 66\\'s Ahh...

When it came under attack from the Polar Tang, one of Blackbeard\\'s subordinates boasted about their admiral\\'s strength.
