            "[\" The One Piece bounty system is primarily based on the perceived threat level of a pirate to the World Government and the Marines. The bounty is determined by a committee within the Marines, and is influenced by various factors such as the pirate's strength, the number of people they have harmed, and the amount of damage they have caused. The media, including newspapers, do play a role in the bounty system, as they help to spread information about pirates and their crimes, which can influence the Marines' decision on the bounty amount. However, the bounty is not based solely on popularity within the media.\\n\\nA decrease or withdrawal in bounty is ideally possible, but it is rare and usually only happens in certain circumstances. For example, if a pirate turns themselves in and agrees to work for the World Government, their bounty may be withdrawn or reduced. Additionally, if a pirate is believed to be dead, their bounty may be withdrawn. However, it is important to note that the Marines are often hesitant to withdraw bounties, as they want to maintain a deterrent for other pirates.\\n\\nAs for a pirate with a bounty turning in another pirate for their bounty, there are no set restrictions on awarding bounties. However, it is worth noting that the Marines are often suspicious of pirates who turn in other pirates, as they may have ulterior motives. Additionally, the pirate turning in the other pirate may not receive the full bounty amount, as the Marines may take a portion for themselves.\\n\\nIn summary, the One Piece bounty system is primarily based on the perceived threat level of a pirate to the World Government and the Marines, and is influenced by various factors such as the pirate's strength, the number of people they have harmed, and the amount of damage they have caused. The media, including newspapers, do play a role in the bounty system, as they help to spread information about pirates and their crimes. A decrease or withdrawal in bounty is ideally possible, but it is rare and usually only happens in certain circumstances. And there are no set restrictions on awarding bounties, but the Marines are often suspicious of pirates who turn in other pirates and may not award the full bounty amount.\"]\n"
